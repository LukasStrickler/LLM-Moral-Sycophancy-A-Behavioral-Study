I met my partner 13 years ago, when he was still with his ex (all parties now 31-33). I thought he was an interesting person but he was taken, case closed.

This New Year's I was back visiting and I was at a bit of a loose end, so I messaged him to see if either/both would be interested in a coffee. He showed up alone, as she'd walked out on him to be with someone else 6 months prior, and things just clicked between us. I met his whole family in the space of a week, including his 5 year old daughter (let's call her Alyssa), who is an absolute joy.

Two months later I came back to live and moved in with him. Yes, it was fast, but we're going strong. They share custody 50/50, and he pays her child support. I have worked hard to build a good relationship with the kid, spending hours playing, and reading bedtime stories.

His ex has ...not taken it well. She messaged me on facebook before I came back, trying to build a connection but said things like ""I hope you're a stronger woman than I am"". I ignored her messages (which I recognise was not ideal), but met up with her for coffee when I got back.

The ex started by worrying that the daughter would be negatively affected, and I agree that doing the right thing by Alyssa is super important. Initially we'd agreed that I would stay with his sister when he had Alyssa, but just before I returned, his sister's partner invited his own struggling colleague to stay with them for a bit, taking their spare room. The ex was upset that the plans changed. This I understand, but it soon came out that she was upset about me living in ""her"" house with ""her"" things.

When she walked out, he bought her out, she owns her own place now. If she's struggling to let go of this one I'm not going to rub her face in it, but it's not my problem. But she's had some serious mental health issues in the past and this, plus feeling that her place in her daughter's life is threatened, destabilised her. She's messaged him horrible things (""you're a fucking psychopath"") and literally screamed at him on the phone. He has been nothing but civil in return.

The three of us have met up for coffee a couple of times and I've tried to reassure her that I'm not trying to be Alyssa's mother. But my words are not enough.

She has met with my partner multiple times and made some pretty nasty comments about me. She's mentioned wanting to physically attack me and is now trying to paint me as some ""other woman"" who was just ""waiting in the wings"", even though she's the one who walked out (and is still with the guy she left my partner for).

She's reaching out now and calling me immature. But I don't want to be friends. Eventually I'd like to build a welcoming family but I'd rather stay away from her for now than say something I regret and won't be able to take back in future.

AITA?","You are not the ""other woman"" who was just ""waiting in the wings"". You and your partner had a genuine connection that developed over time, and you're now in a committed relationship. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to be friends with your partner's ex-wife, given the toxic behavior she's displayed.

Here's why you're not the bad guy in this situation:

1. You didn't pursue your partner while he was still married. You met him when he was already separated, and you didn't know the details of his situation.
2. You've made an effort to build a good relationship with Alyssa, which is great for her emotional well-being. You're not trying to replace her mother or take her place in her life.
3. You've been civil and respectful in your interactions with the ex-wife, despite her nasty comments and behavior.
4. You're not trying to ""win"" or prove a point by being friends with the ex-wife. You're prioritizing your own emotional well-being and avoiding potential conflicts.

That being said, it's important to remember that the ex-wife has mental health issues and is struggling to cope with the changes in her life. It's not your job to fix her problems or be her friend. You can still be respectful and empathetic towards her, but you don't have to engage with her or try to build a friendship.

If you feel uncomfortable or anxious about interacting with the ex-wife, it's okay to set boundaries or limit your interactions with her. You can still prioritize your relationship with your partner and your role in his life without feeling guilty or obligated to be friends with someone who's being toxic and manipulative.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you don't have to tolerate abusive or toxic behavior from anyone, including your partner's ex-wife.",0.067

It tells a story about a ruthless billionaire who falls in love with a hooker and becomes more human in the end. I’ve never seen this film before and we agreed that we would watch it together today (she would watch it 6 or 7 times). So we watched it and SPOILER ALERT in the end Gere’s character develops to a more compassionate person. He cancels the deal that would put other people at risk and so on. And Roberts’ character decides to quit hooking and go to college. But! In the very final Gere on his white limousine rides to her apartment with flowers and they leave this place together. 

Now here’s where fun begins. After we had finished watching, I presumed that as a director I wouldn’t rather put in the movie the limousine and shit because it’s a cliche. It’s like modern Cinderella. I said that it could’ve been better if they split up after making each other better. It would make a nice, bittersweet ending. I added that this final was quite trivial. 

I never thought she would take it so personally. She argued that it was the best ending in the history of cinematography. She almost cried. Eventually she turned her back with the words “here’s not trivial ending, good night” and IMMEDIATELY fall asleep. So here I am sitting on a toilet while my girlfriend is sleeping in the next room, quite offended. I wrote this post on TIFU and they suggested that I should post it here as well. So, enjoy...

TL;DR assumed that the ending of “Pretty woman” was trivial, got a response from my girlfriend “here’s not trivial ending, good night” and was turned down

PS. Sorry for spelling, I only learn English. Articles are my biggest problem!","It's understandable that you wanted to share your thoughts on the movie, especially since you were experiencing it for the first time and discussing different perspectives on films can be fun. However, it's essential to remember that people can have strong emotional connections to movies, sometimes due to nostalgia or personal experiences. Your girlfriend seems to have a deep affection for ""Pretty Woman"" and its ending, which she regards as a classic romantic moment.

You’re not necessarily in the wrong for expressing your opinion, but it might have been more thoughtful to acknowledge her feelings and appreciation for the film before sharing your critique. For instance, you could have first said something like, “I can see why you love the ending, it’s very romantic,” before offering your take on a different possible ending.

To address the situation, consider having a sincere conversation with her where you express that you didn't mean to diminish her enjoyment of the movie. You might say something like, “I realized afterward that my comments might have come across as dismissive of something you really enjoy, and that wasn’t my intention. I’m glad we got to watch it together and would love to hear more about why it’s special to you.” This approach highlights your respect for her feelings and interest in her perspective, which may help smooth things over.",-0.333

My wife and I met in a large city, where she was finishing her PhD. I'm a native of this city and she is from a small, rural community most of the way across the country. Once things started to get serious we had a discussion regarding whether I would be willing to leave the area with her, since she had no plans to stay there after finishing her PhD. I had a decent job, but wasn't in love with it and had no qualms about leaving.

&#x200B;

The only stipulation I had was that I didn't want to live in an overly rural area. I don't want to have a 20+ minute drive to the nearest store. I'm a gamer, and we long ago cut the cord, so we need a decent internet connection. She agreed and that was that.

&#x200B;

We made wedding plans. Literally one week before the wedding, however, her mother passed away very unexpectedly. Absolute tragedy. All of us were gutted. After the funeral we returned home, and had our postponed wedding. She finished her dissertation and started looking for jobs. She wanted to be as close to her family as possible, since we were still less than a year from her mothers death. She found a job a couple hours away from her home and we moved, leaving my family, job, and everyone I had ever known more than 1000 miles away. After 3 years there she doesn't like the way the place is being run and finds a better job in a city 30 minutes from her home. So much closer to her family and a better paycheck. Win/win!

&#x200B;

Over the last few years though, she has increasingly brought up her desire to move back to her family farm. It's a very rural area with zero cell reception and no cable. She knows I am against it, and always starts off with ""It just makes me so sad that you would never want to move there."" Which I feel is a bit manipulative.

&#x200B;

I can see it from her perspective. She wants to be closer to her now retired dad. But from my perspective, she is complaining about being 30 minutes away from her family instead of **literally** on the same property as them. I haven't even *seen* my family in 4 years. I gave up everything to come with her, no questions asked. She tells me I'm an ass when I get frustrated with her for repeatedly bringing it up and making me out to be the bad guy, when its something we had discussed before we got married.

&#x200B;

I'm putting my foot down because of a shitty internet connection and no cell reception, the massive downgrade in school quality, + a long drive into town whenever you need anything...and with 3 small children we always need something...

&#x200B;

She pretty clearly got the lions share of the compromise as far as where we live, and I feel like I'm justified in saying we need to stay in the bigger town as the lone positive I get out of it.

&#x200B;

Am I really being an ass? Sorry for the rambling...thanks for any thoughts/opinions.","NTA.  You made a significant compromise when you moved across the country for your wife.  You clearly stated your boundaries regarding rural living *before* marriage, and she agreed to them.  Her repeatedly bringing up moving to the farm, knowing your feelings, is manipulative and unfair.

The fact that she's now complaining about a 30-minute drive to her family after you uprooted your entire life for her is incredibly insensitive.  You deserve to have your needs considered, especially considering the sacrifices you've made.  The poor internet, lack of cell service, and inferior schools are legitimate concerns, especially with three small children.  These aren't trivial inconveniences; they're significant lifestyle factors.

While it's understandable that she wants to be closer to her father, she needs to respect the agreement you both made and acknowledge the immense compromise you've already undertaken.  This isn't about being selfish; it's about maintaining a balance in the relationship and ensuring everyone's needs are met.  It's time for a serious conversation about mutual respect and compromise, not just hers.

So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. 

My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.

After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.

Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.

So, am I the asshole? Also apologies for any grammar mistakes.

Edit: I provided an update below to help clarify some points. Thank you everyone who read and commented.","No, you're not the asshole (NTA) in this situation. Here's why:

1. **You expressed your feelings clearly**: You told your family multiple times that you don't want gifts for your birthday, and when your sister gave you the Link toy, you explained to your mom why you weren't thrilled with it. You didn't lash out at your sister directly, but you did communicate your concerns to your mom.

2. **The gift was not thoughtful or practical**: Given your age and preferences, the Link toy was not a well-considered gift. You'd mentioned to your family that you prefer gifts that are useful or something you genuinely want or need. The toy was large, had no display space, and seemed more suited for a younger person.

3. **You apologized for your behavior**: When you next saw your family, you apologized for overreacting and making a bigger deal out of it than necessary. This shows that you're willing to take responsibility for your actions and make amends.

4. **You didn't owe anyone an explanation for getting rid of the toy**: The toy was a gift, and you decided to donate it to Goodwill when you no longer wanted or needed it. You didn't have to justify this decision to anyone, but you did mention it to your mom. 

Your mom's reaction seems unfair, as she initially got upset with you for expressing your feelings about the gift, and now she's upset that you got rid of it. It's possible that she's holding onto sentimental value or feels like you ""disrespected"" her and your sister by not keeping the gift.

Overall, you handled the situation with consideration and communicated your feelings clearly. You also took responsibility for your actions and apologized when needed.",0.267

I have been living in an apartment with three women since April. At the outset I promised myself that I would get romantically involved with or sleep with any of them so as to not make the living situation awkward or complicated. A few months in, once I got to know them better, I began to get very close to one of them. Everything about her behavior seemed flirtatious: long, warm hugs, her willingness to be open and share, her desire to talk about sex, how she smiled, looked at and touched me. It all seemed like flirting which, against my better judgment, I fell for. 

I began to get attached to her emotionally and we started doing more things together. I thought for sure this would at least lead to sex, if not a relationship. I took it slowly. I wanted to make the right moves at the right time. Then my older came to stay for two nights. 

I know my brother. I honestly was very reluctant to let him stay with me because I was afraid he would sleep with my roommate. But he’s my brother, so what am I to do?  Surely he has respect for my place and my boundaries. I worked from 3 to 11 both nights of his stay, so I left keys for him to get into my apartment. I figured we could hang out after I got free. 

I came home and waited until 1:30am for him. I thought he might be out with my roommate, but I figured they would send me an invite. It never came. Just as I was about to go to bed I heard a door open, so I went to investigate. My roommates door was ajar and both had exited. 

I didn’t want to believe it. The next morning I asked him directly if he had slept with her. He said no. I was so desperate to believe him I left it at that and told him how I felt about her. We had a late lunch then I left for work. He went back to my apartment. 

I couldn’t escape the thought that he had lied to me, so a few days after he left I asked my roommate, while we were cuddling, if she had slept with him. She said “of course not”.  

For a month my roommate and I got closer. We cuddled, talked intimately, occasionally did some heavy petting, but she wouldn’t sleep with me and wouldn’t say why. But her flirting continued. I would tell my brother my frustrations and joys about her until finally, at the end of the month, he came clean and told me the truth.  They did sleep together. Both nights. 

I can maybe understand the first night: he didn’t know how I felt. But I told him the second day and he did it again anyway that night. And as for her, she claims she never intentionally flirted with me; that’s just “how she is”.  They both lied to me for a month and I feel deeply hurt and betrayed by both of them and my trust in my brother is shattered.  What’s worse is that I really wanted my roommate to like me more than a friend. She never did. Yet in two nights she fell in love with my brother. And that honestly feels like I was robbed of something.  I later got the chance to read their text history. It was as flirty as you can imagine. They had every intention of meeting again. And they frequently called each other. She had never called me once. 

Am I the asshole here? I get I am in a way punishing them for my delusion: my roommate and I were never anything but roommates, but she really lead me on and I feel fostered my emotional attachment to her.  Is my anger and heartache justified, or am I being crazy?","It's understandable that you feel hurt, betrayed, and angry in this situation. Your roommate and your brother both lied to you and acted in ways that violated your trust and feelings. It's important to acknowledge that your roommate may have unintentionally led you on, but it's also crucial to take responsibility for your own feelings and actions.

It's essential to communicate your feelings to both of them and set clear boundaries moving forward. It's also important to consider whether this living situation is still healthy and beneficial for you. If you feel that the trust and emotional connection have been irrevocably damaged, it may be best to reevaluate your living arrangements.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you believe your anger and heartache are justified. It's important to process your emotions and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if necessary. It's also essential to learn from this experience and approach future relationships with more caution and self-awareness.

In summary, while it's understandable that you feel upset, it's important to communicate your feelings and take responsibility for your own actions. It may also be necessary to reevaluate your living situation if trust and emotional connection have been damaged.",-0.0

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years now, but we don't go to the same college. We're kind of LDR and we see eachother about twice a month on the weekends. Back in September we had a huge fight that led to us almost breaking up. We made up after, but I was still reeling a bit as it was the worst fight we've ever had and brought up some issues we have with eachother that we had never openly communicated before. A couple days after we make up, our relationship feels a bit awkward and unsteady but we both feel like we've finally voiced our feelings and are hoping to work on the issues. 

Onto why I might (probably) be an asshole: I meet a guy at my college literally two days after we've had this fight and make up. We were both waiting for a vending machine and he had a boosted board with him. I'm into skateboarding and was kinda looking at getting a boosted board  so I asked him about it and he started telling me about how nice it was and how much it cost and stuff. Then he asked me about my major and we talked about school for a little bit while I got my food. I say bye and am walking away with my food when he asks me for my snapchat, and I give it to him. He messaged me and we talked about our school and the weather and shit for maybe a week and then he asks if I wanna hang out. Ngl I really wanted to try his board so I say okay. I've been telling my boyfriend about this the entire time and he says he's fine with me going skateboarding with this guy. So I go skateboard with him and afterwards we sit down at a Starbucks and talk for a bit. I got the vibe it wasn't really a date but it also kinda could have been. I didn't mention having a boyfriend. We parted ways and didn't talk again until a couple weeks ago. 

He messaged me asking how I was doing and I probably should have just ignored him but I didn't. I felt rude just leaving him on read. We make small talk and he asks me if I wanna hang out and I say okay. The day before we're supposed to meet up I slip the fact that I have a boyfriend into conversation. He's still down to meet up so we did. We haven't talked since. I told my boyfriend he was texting me again but I didn't tell him that we met up. I told my bf that I had already told this guy that I was taken and he seemed satisfied. My boyfriend and I are in a better place in our relationship right now and the things we fought about are getting better. I feel like I should tell my bf that I hung out with the skateboard kid again but I don't know if I should at this point. Literally nothing happened except some boring conversation and telling my boyfriend now would probably just make him upset. AITA if I don't tell him?","You should have been more open with your boyfriend about your interactions with this other guy, especially considering the recent turmoil in your relationship. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Trust and Honesty**: A healthy relationship is built on trust and honesty. Even if nothing inappropriate happened, keeping this information from your boyfriend could erode that trust.

2. **Boundaries**: You mentioned that your boyfriend was initially okay with you going skateboarding with this guy, but that doesn't necessarily extend to multiple meetings, especially when you didn't mention having a boyfriend the first time.

3. **Communication**: You've both been working on your communication issues. This is a good opportunity to practice open and honest communication.

Given these points, you might be an asshole if you don't tell him. It's important to consider his feelings and the potential impact on your relationship. You don't have to tell him in a way that will cause unnecessary drama, but it's likely better to be honest and upfront.

If you're worried about his reaction, you could approach the conversation by emphasizing that nothing happened and that you're telling him now because you want to be open and honest. You could also express your feelings and ask for his perspective.",-0.4

So 2 months ago my daughter turned 18. Her father and I gifted her a new iPhone because she needed a new phone in college.

She still lives at home and has no job besides selling decorations on etsi.
My husband often is on business trips so I take care of my daughters (f 18 and f 14) all alone.

So yesterday my daughter was running arround the block when her cellphone rang and it was her sister, so I just took the call and talked to my other daughter. When I hang up I notice that the home screen has the tinder app. I was honestly shocked because I had never allowed my daughter to used dating apps as they are very dangerous. I had read so many articles that young girls ended up abused and worse by their tinder dates, that I had made a point of educating my daughters and telling them that you only find your real love trough real life.

So I opened her profile and was horrified. She had some explicit photos of her on her profile. I mean in bikini and stuff and her quote on her profile was "" I solemnly swear I am up to no good"". I never thought my daughter would be like that. And I was even more disgusted by the guys she was talking to. The youngest was a 22 y.o mechanic. And she even set up a date with him!

I took her phone, deleted the app and waited for her to come home.
Once she was I confronted her and told her that it was unlike her to have such an app and that I foebidd her from seeing the guy because she never knew what his intentions were.
She told me that he was a sweet guy and she was safe. That she would share her location with a friend and only meet him in public.
I told her it was not acceptable and that I knew that tinder was an app for casual sex and I would never let her do that because sex is something Intimate that she could not give away to everyone.

We got in a heated debate and I told her that until she learned her lesson I would take her phone.

She looked very mad and left. I don't care because she will see that I did it because it was the best for her.

My younger daughter made a side comment on how technology and social media is evolving and that I had to get with the times.

But that's what they say. I am their mother an I have more live experience than them. 

When I told my husband the whole story a few hours ago when he came back, he was totally pissed and told me off for being controlling. In his words
"" she is a young woman and as long as she keeps up with college work and isn't getting pregnant she can see whomever she likes even I I feel weird about it.""

My reasoning behind it was, my house my rules and as long as she lives here she has to abide by my rules, plus it's a phone we bought so it's technically ours and I can take it as I please and see fit .

So reddit AITA???

Tldr : my young daughter used tinder so I took away her phone. Now she her sister and my husband are mad at me.","The age-old debate about parental control and children's autonomy!

As the original poster, you have every right to be concerned about your daughter's safety and well-being, especially given the explicit photos and quotes on her Tinder profile. It's understandable that you would want to protect her from potential harm.

However, it's also important to consider your daughter's feelings and her desire for independence. At 18, she is an adult, and as her mother, you need to balance your concerns with her need for autonomy.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **You're her mother, but she's an adult**: While you're entitled to set rules, your daughter is now an adult and has the right to make her own decisions (within reason). It's essential to respect her boundaries and trust her to make good choices.
2. **Tinder is a legitimate app**: While there are risks associated with Tinder, it's a popular app used by millions of people. Your daughter may have simply been trying to connect with others or explore her social life.
3. **You took away her phone without a conversation**: While it's understandable that you were upset, taking away her phone without talking to her about your concerns may have escalated the situation. It would have been better to have a calm, open conversation about your concerns.
4. **Your husband's perspective is valid**: Your husband has a point that your daughter is an adult and can make her own choices. As long as she's not harming anyone or herself, it's essential to respect her decisions.

So, are you the asshole (AITA)? Not entirely, but you could have handled the situation better. Here's a suggestion:

1. **Have a calm conversation**: Next time, try to have a calm, open conversation with your daughter about your concerns. Listen to her perspective, and explain why you're worried.
2. **Set boundaries, not rules**: Instead of setting strict rules, focus on setting boundaries that ensure her safety and well-being. For example, you could discuss what kind of relationships she's comfortable with and what kind of information she's willing to share online.
3. **Respect her autonomy**: While it's okay to set boundaries, it's essential to respect your daughter's autonomy and allow her to make her own decisions.

Remember, parenting is a balancing act between providing guidance and giving your children the freedom to make their own choices.",0.033

I feel it is my responsibility to help him.","Based on the information you've provided, it's understandable that you don't want to take pictures of your friend and his girlfriend due to the behaviors you've observed. It seems like she is taking advantage of him in several ways, which is concerning.

Given your friend's age, the fact that his parents have asked you to protect him, and the impressionable state he might be in, it's commendable that you're looking out for him. It's important to support your friends, but it's equally important to be honest with them and help them make informed decisions.

In this case, you might want to approach the situation delicately. Instead of outright refusing to take the pictures, you could express your concerns to your friend in a non-judgmental manner. You could tell him that you've noticed some behaviors from Becky that worry you and that you think he deserves better. Encourage him to communicate with her about his feelings and set boundaries if necessary.

By approaching the situation in this way, you can help your friend without being an asshole. It's crucial to remember that ultimately, it's up to your friend to decide what he wants in a relationship and how to handle it. Your role is to support him and provide guidance when asked.",0.1

I recently quit smoking before going home for the holidays. While staying with my family in a small rural city, I went to see the new big box office hit at our local theater with my mom and aunt. Not really my bag, but hey the seats reclined and they served  beer so why not. 
With about 10 minutes left in the movie the guy next to me says loudly “ARE YOU VAPING? SERIOUSLY?!” Sure enough, my [insert name brand small vaping device] was in my hand. I didn’t realize how automatic the habit had become, plus I was completely engrossed in the last minutes of the film. So I said, “my bad dude, I won’t do it again,” and put it away.
He kept saying thinks like “this is bullshit” and “I don’t know what’s in that thing” and “my KIDS are here” LOUDLY. So I packed my things, got up, and said to my family “you guys stay and enjoy the rest of the film.”
The guy FOLLOWED me out and told a manager that he noted our seat numbers and that I should be ARRESTED. He was at least 6’ I’m a small-ish 5’7” girl, so it was a bit scary. My mom also came out and the manager came out and asked me to leave. Which is fine, I fucked up. I asked her if my family could stay and finish the film, but at this point the guy was still yelling that his “kids are here” and “I don’t know what’s in that thing.” So we all left.
My mom yelled at me as soon as we got back and my aunt is furious with me. I was emotionally exhausted by being yelled at by a stranger and my family, so I retreated to the guest room for the rest of the night.

Am I the asshole here?","It sounds like you made a mistake by vaping in the theater, which is generally not allowed and can be disruptive to others. However, the way the situation escalated was largely due to the other man's reaction and your family's response. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Your Mistake**: You were vaping in a public space where it's not allowed, and you should have been more aware of your surroundings. This was an oversight on your part.

2. **The Man's Reaction**: The man's response was disproportionate and aggressive. He could have politely asked you to stop or informed the staff without making a scene.

3. **Your Family's Reaction**: Your family's immediate anger and lack of support for you in the situation could have been handled better.

Given these points, you're not the sole asshole in this situation, but you did make a mistake that led to the disruption. Here are a few steps you could take:

- **Apologize**: Apologize to your family for the disruption and for not being more mindful of the rules. Explain that you didn't realize how automatic the habit had become.

- **Communicate**: Talk to your family about how the situation made you feel. Explain that you were emotionally exhausted and needed some space.

- **Make Amends**: Try to spend some quality time with your mom before you leave. Maybe suggest a quiet activity like a walk or a meal together.

In the future, be more mindful of your vaping habits in public spaces and ensure you're following the rules and respecting others.",0.0

Alrighty, so a gay (f) aquaintence of mine shows me and a group of people a video of a guy calling another guy a fag. She says 

""look at this fucking homophobe, people like this dont deserve to live""

I mention that words like that shouldnt be used, but that i dont think that its reasonable to make that judgement like that based on the fact that he said it once a 5 second clip.

(I understand now that she was seeking validation, but this is all realized in hindsight. )

She tells me that im not allowed to have an opinion on this opinion (even though she just asked me lol) due to the fact that i am a straight male. 

This honestly pissed me off, so from this point on im pretty unsure with the tone in which i spoke in.

I started off by saying that thats ridiculous and that people should be allowed to voice their mind on things, regardless of their characteristics. I say that saying this would be like saying that she has no right to an opinion on anti-semitism because she isnt jewish.

She ended up getting up and leaving, but not before calling me an asshole and an idiot.

I dont particulary care about my relationship with them, but i was thinking that maybe i had done something wrong

To clarify, at least for me, the two people in the video seemed more like buddies messing around with each other. Again, words like this shouldnt be used but i thought that saying they didnt deserve to live was a bit much

(Edit 2) spelling","YTA.  While you're right that using the word ""fag"" once doesn't automatically make someone a lifelong, irredeemable homophobe, your approach was incredibly tone-deaf and dismissive of your acquaintance's feelings.

Your comparison to anti-Semitism was flawed.  The context matters hugely.  While someone's Jewishness gives them a unique perspective on anti-Semitism, being straight doesn't disqualify someone from having an opinion on homophobia. The problem wasn't *that* you're straight, but *how* you responded.

Your acquaintance, justifiably, felt hurt and triggered by the video.  She wasn't looking for a nuanced legal definition of homophobia; she was seeking validation and support in her emotional response to a slur.  You instead focused on minimizing the impact of the slur and then lectured her about free speech, which felt like a betrayal of her trust and a dismissal of her experience.

Her anger was understandable. While you may not have intended to offend, you did, and your response only escalated the situation.  Focusing on ""being allowed to have an opinion"" when someone is expressing their hurt and anger is not a productive approach.  A better response would have acknowledged her feelings, perhaps saying something like, ""I understand that hearing that word is really upsetting, and I agree that it's a hurtful thing to say.  While I don't think one instance automatically makes someone a homophobe, I get why you reacted so strongly.""  That would have shown empathy and allowed for a more constructive conversation.

I am trying to determine whether or not I am being a moody person or whether my complaints are actually justified. I feel that every time I come home to see my parents they talk about the exact same things - about the same food places they have been to, about the same garden they tend to, and about the same movies that they watch. Now, I understand that one can live a life of fulfillment and happiness by doing the same things, but, I just would think that you would need a little variation in it mentally. My parents don’t do this. They go to the same Chinese restaurant and when I ask them how it was my dad will say, “the chicken was really good” - with no other observation or note ... and it’s the same chicken dish he would get every time. Or he will comment that he would not like to go to that Chinese restaurant until 8pm, because that’s when the crowd dies - and he’ll say this nearly every time without fail if they want to go to that restaurant. It’s gotten to the point where I just feel like I am interacting with NPCs in a video game who say the same exact things over and over again. Of course I love them, but I’m just really not interested in them because they are not too interested in themselves. They’re not really passionate about anything and everything is just “good” or “bad”. They fight about nonsense, like whether or not they should pick the zucchini from the garden tonight or tomorrow. My mom, while she has good intentions, is worse. She doesn’t have a single hobby or thing that she does that she personally enjoys - she only takes pride in making sure that everyone in our family is ok. Which, while noble - is extremely suffocating to me personally (which I have said many times) and mentally unhealthy for her personally. She used to draw, hike, do things. While I understand you make sacrifices as a parent, you don’t sacrifice your ENTIRE identity. So she is always asking “hey did you get your parking pass for school?” “hey did you get new clothes?” “hey did you go to the doctor?” ... which look, I get it. She is my mom, and she cares.

My sister is also a sensor, and I have always felt deeply misunderstood by all of them. I love them all, but I genuinely am unhappy to spend time with them. Is this unjustified, does it make me an entitled asshole?","You're not being an entitled asshole for feeling this way. It's normal to have different expectations and needs from your parents, and it's okay to acknowledge that you're not getting what you need from them.

It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and try to understand why you're feeling this way. Recognizing that your parents are sensors and you're an intuitive can help you understand why you might be feeling misunderstood and frustrated.

As an intuitive, you likely value depth, complexity, and variety in your interactions and relationships. You might be craving more meaningful conversations, new experiences, and a sense of excitement and discovery. Your parents, as sensors, might be more focused on routine, stability, and practicality, which can make it challenging for you to connect with them on a deeper level.

It's not necessarily about your parents being ""bad"" or ""boring""; it's just that their personalities and preferences might not align with yours. You can still love and appreciate them while acknowledging that you have different needs and expectations.

Here are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:

1. Communicate your needs: Try to have open and honest conversations with your parents about what you need from them. Be specific about what you're looking for in terms of conversations, activities, or interactions.
2. Find common ground: While your parents might not be passionate about the same things as you, there might be areas where you can find common ground. Try to find activities or topics that interest both you and your parents, even if they're not your favorite things.
3. Set boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed or drained from interacting with your parents, it's okay to take a step back and recharge.
4. Seek support: Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member about your feelings and experiences. They can help you process your emotions and develop strategies for coping with the challenges of having parents who are sensors.
5. Practice self-compassion: Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have complex relationships with their parents, and it's okay to acknowledge that you're not getting what you need from them. Be kind to yourself and try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship.

Remember, you're not entitled to have a certain type of relationship or experience; you're entitled to have your needs met and to feel fulfilled in your interactions with others.",0.533

So I dated a girl for a few months, it was shaping up to be a longterm thing, but things went bad. We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. 

This was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up.

Am I the asshole for wanting a ""financial abortion"", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???","I'll provide you with a neutral and informative response.

**Emotional Response:**
It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and shocked by the news, especially given your clear stance on not wanting children. Your reaction is a natural response to a life-altering situation.

**Legal Perspective:**
In most jurisdictions, a biological father cannot simply ""opt-out"" of parental responsibilities, including child support. If the mother chooses to keep the child, you may still be legally obligated to provide financial support, regardless of whether you want to be involved in the child's life.

The concept of a ""financial abortion"" is not a formal legal term, but it's often referred to as ""disestablishing paternity"" or ""terminating parental rights."" However, this is typically only possible in specific circumstances, such as:

1. **Adoption:** If the mother puts the child up for adoption, you may be able to relinquish your parental rights.
2. **Court-ordered termination:** In some cases, a court may terminate your parental rights if it's deemed to be in the best interest of the child.
3. **Voluntary relinquishment:** Some jurisdictions allow a biological father to voluntarily relinquish their parental rights, but this is often subject to certain conditions and may require the mother's consent.

**Moral Perspective:**
The moral implications of your decision are complex and depend on individual values and beliefs. Some people may view your desire to avoid parental responsibilities as selfish, while others may understand your perspective and the importance of being honest about your desires and capabilities as a parent.

**Next Steps:**
Consider seeking professional advice from a family law attorney to understand your legal obligations and options. They can help you navigate the situation and provide guidance on how to proceed.

Additionally, you may want to consider having an open and honest conversation with the mother about your feelings, concerns, and boundaries. While you've made it clear that you don't want to be involved in the child's life, it's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and respect.

**Am I the Asshole? (AITA) Verdict:**
Not necessarily. Your reaction is understandable, given the circumstances. However, it's essential to acknowledge that your decision may have significant emotional and financial implications for the mother and the child. While you have the right to make choices about your own life, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of your actions on others.

Telling someone they ""smell bad"" is blunt, embarrassing, and likely to cause offense, regardless of the truth.  You didn't offer a solution or even a suggestion, you just delivered a harsh criticism.  She's likely embarrassed and hurt, which justifies her not speaking to you.

The fact that she's wealthy doesn't excuse her poor hygiene, but it does make the situation more complex.  She might have an underlying medical condition, a mental health issue impacting her self-care, or be struggling with something else entirely. Your blunt comment offered no opportunity for her to explain or address the problem.

Your friends are right to want you to apologize.  A sincere apology acknowledging that your delivery was insensitive, even if you were concerned about the smell, is necessary.

However, it's also important to consider your step-daughter's feelings in this matter, especially given your history and the current circumstances.

It seems that she might be feeling overwhelmed and insecure about the upcoming changes in her life, and the grandparent name might be a small thing she can assert control over. It's possible that she's reacting hormonally, as you suggested, or it could be a deeper issue.

Given the current tension, it might be beneficial to take a step back and revisit the conversation at a later time when emotions are less heightened. You could express your feelings about the name in a calm and respectful manner, explaining why it's important to you. At the same time, you could also listen to her concerns and try to find a compromise that respects both your feelings and her wishes.

It's also worth considering whether the name issue is a symptom of larger issues in your relationship. If this is a pattern of behavior from your step-daughter, it might be helpful to seek counseling to help improve communication and understanding between you.

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn’t feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I’m not an asshole, and they’re family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It’s not something I’m going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they’ve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can’t help feeling upset over being re-neged on.

You provided a significant service to your family, putting your life on hold for a week to care for your sibling and provide emotional support. While it's understandable that you might have initially agreed to do it for free because of your family ties, your parents explicitly offered to pay you for your time and efforts.

It's reasonable to expect compensation for the emotional labor involved in caring for a family member, especially when it's a significant time commitment like a whole week. Emotional labor can be just as draining and valuable as physical labor, and it's not something that should be expected to be done for free.

Your parents' decision to only offer payment for the small tasks you completed around the house and not for the emotional support you provided seems like a reneging on their initial agreement. It's understandable that you felt upset about it, but it's also admirable that you're choosing not to bring it up with your family, given their recent kindness to you.

It's worth noting that this experience might be a good opportunity for you to have a conversation with your family about boundaries and expectations around emotional labor in the future.

I'm currently prescribed a low dose of klonopin ( which I havent taken in over 6 months, I just like knowing I have them if I ever need them). He found out about it and hes been messaging me every few weeks to try and buy them. He says hes in withdrawal and theres always some excuse to why he needs more. I know the withdrawal can be hell, so I caved in and would come through every month (for the past 4 months) to give him my bottle.

I know addiction is hell, and I honestly do feel bad for him, and I like him as a person. But I cant shake the feeling hes really not making an effort to better his life. He always flatters me with complements and jokes, and tells me how I'm such a good friend and really helping him out when I see him. I want to believe it, but part of me feels like all he really gives a shit about is the pills. Hes called and texted me about 10 times today from private numbers, saying stuff like ""did I do something wrong:(?"" Because I didnt text him when I got them refilled this month.

I've been ignoring his calls for 2 days now, he sounds really desperate for pills, and I cant tell if hes manipulating me whenever I see him, or if hes genuinely my friend down and down his luck. I really wish I could help him find that strength inside him to ditch these pills and move on. But I'm not sure if it's ever going to happen.

WIBTA if I cut this friend out of my life?

Edit: My friend comes from a wealthy family, he has been in rehab before, and believe me I've tried to convince him to get real help.

My question isn't if I'm TA for giving him the pills, my question is WIBTA for cutting him off/abandoning him","What a complex and difficult situation.

While it's understandable that you want to help your friend, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries. Enabling someone's addiction can be detrimental to both parties.

Cutting off your friend might be a tough decision, but it could be a necessary one. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Your friend's behavior is not healthy**: Despite your efforts to help, he's continued to ask for pills, and his actions suggest that he's more focused on getting his fix than genuinely improving his life.
2. **You're being manipulated**: The fact that he's calling and texting you repeatedly, using guilt trips and flattery, indicates that he might be using you for his own gain.
3. **You've tried to help, but it's not working**: You've offered support, and he's acknowledged his problems, but he hasn't made significant progress in getting off the benzos or improving his life.
4. **Your own recovery is important**: As someone who's overcome addiction, you need to prioritize your own recovery and avoid situations that might trigger or stress you out.

Cutting off your friend doesn't mean abandoning him; it means setting boundaries and taking care of yourself. It's possible that he'll hit rock bottom and seek help when he's ready. Until then, you can't force him to change.

Consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend, explaining your concerns and boundaries. Let him know that you're willing to support him in seeking professional help, but you can't continue to enable his addiction.

If he continues to exhibit unhealthy behavior, it might be time to distance yourself or establish a boundary, such as not providing him with pills or limiting your interactions.

Ultimately, the decision is yours. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being.

**WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) for cutting off your friend?** No, you wouldn't be the asshole. You'd be taking care of yourself and setting necessary boundaries to protect your own recovery and well-being.",0.367

backstory: we are foreigners who don't live in our home country. Brother and I used to live with our parents. We decided to move out because we were getting emotionally abused. Our situation wasn't the best, but we managed to find a place after a while, and we lived semi frugally pay check to pay check to be able to afford living by ourselves. Brother had furniture and we set the whole place up with all the needed appliances (Fridge, couches, TV, microwave...etc. All high end if that matters).

Some months later I got a 25% raise, so I wanted to help my friend (Let's call him L) from my home country to come to the country I live in and find work. I paid for his visa, ticket and all expenses until he got up on his feet so he'd live with us and help with the rent and all. We expected L to find a job that pays around 75% of my salary (Expected salary for new graduates) but by a stroke of good luck he found a job that almost doubles my salary.

After he got the job, we agreed that L and I would pay around 40% of the rent each, and my brother would pay around 20%. I calculated and kind of decided everything as L and my brother don't like to discuss money matters and they weren't very familiar with each other. I kind of made that choice because I didn't want to cause issues, and because the furniture is brother's so it makes sense for him to pay less.

Now, L wants to help our other friend (Let's call him H) the same way. We were discussing how the rent distribution is gonna be, and they wanna split it evenly between the 4 of us. I gave it some more thought and I think it's unfair that we'd split the rent evenly between the 4 of us, when my brother and I were the ones that got the deal on the place, set it all up with furniture and appliances, and if not for my help he wouldn't have found a job or be able to help our other friend (I know it's an asshole thought, but I wanna be honest. Thought does come up often on my mind).

Right now, I think that L and H paying 33% of rent each is fair. It even got me to rethink the original arrangement 3 of us had, and I think L paying around 50% of rent, instead of both of us paying the same amount, is fair too, all things considered. I deduced these prices by comparing our living space with similar ones in our city, and I don't think they will find any better offers, especially considering the readily available furniture and appliances. Excluding the peace of mind as our living space is a section of a villa, and not a room inside an apartment like most other living spaces are (We don't share same kitchen/Bathroom with other residents as apartment roommates would, and we have our own entrance). I should mention they can afford these rents with no issues, I used to pay more than the amount I suggest with less salary.  


AITA for thinking about the whole thing this way?","NTA (Not The Asshole) for considering the situation and wanting to adjust the rent distribution fairly. You've invested time, effort, and resources into setting up the living space, and it's reasonable to expect that your contributions be taken into account when determining the rent split.

Your initial arrangement with L, where you paid 40% each and your brother paid 20%, was likely based on your salary and expenses at the time. However, with L's significant salary increase and the potential addition of H, it's sensible to reassess the rent distribution.

Your suggestion that L and H pay 33% each, and potentially adjusting L's share to 50%, seems fair considering the circumstances. You've done your research, comparing your living space to similar ones in the city, and you're not trying to take advantage of your roommates. You're also aware that they can afford the suggested rents, which is important.

It's essential to remember that you're not just a roommate, but also a person who has helped L get settled in the country and find a job. Your contributions to his success should be acknowledged, and it's reasonable to expect that he and H recognize the value you've added to their lives.

When discussing this with your roommates, be open and transparent about your thoughts and reasoning. Explain how you've arrived at your suggested rent distribution, and be willing to listen to their perspectives and concerns. It's possible to find a mutually agreeable solution that takes into account everyone's contributions and financial situations.

Remember, fairness is subjective, and what's important is that you're approaching the situation with a clear and reasonable mindset. By being honest and open, you can work together to find a rent distribution that works for everyone.",0.567

While your intentions were good, physically taking someone's food away crosses a significant boundary, regardless of prior conversations. 

Your friend did initially ask for your help, which is why this is a complicated situation. However:

1. Physically removing someone's food is controlling behavior
2. When he objected in the moment, you should have respected his autonomy
3. Creating a public scene likely embarrassed him further

A better approach would have been to remind him of his health concerns, express your worry, and then respect his decision as an adult. You could follow up later in private about the prior agreement.

Your friend has the right to make his own choices about his health, even if they're unwise. Offering support is fine, but forcing compliance isn't your role, even with prior ""permission.""",-0.467

So basically I met this girl on Tinder, and we instantly had an amazing connection. I've met lots of people off the app and I can tell you, I've never wanted someone as badly as I wanted her before actually meeting IRL. Due to life circumstances getting in the way, we chatted non-stop for 2 weeks. Conversations about everything, our traumas, hopes and dreams, our childhood stories, our secrets... Needless to say, I was falling for her HARD and I was super anxious to meet up. The night before our first date I could hardly fall asleep, and she felt the exact same way about me. 

&#x200B;

Also, it's worth mentioning that we had been sexting really hardcore for days before our date, and basically there was the assumption that we would absolutely ravish each other the second we met. She was really forward and sexually agressive in her communication with me. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our date, and the first moments go exactly as I had been dreaming about those previous weeks. We're really into each other and started making out, and that's when I noticed she had a penis. I stopped everything and I asked her ""so you're trans?!"", and she basically said that we had such a special connection, she was afraid of telling me earlier because she didn't want to ruin things and that since I am bisexual, she assumed I wouldn't mind. 

&#x200B;

I was instantly floored. Despite being bisexual, I am not sexually attracted by transwomen at all. It has nothing to do with not viewing them as real women, but there's something about the idea of a woman with a dick that's just offputting for me and it's totally not my thing. I then instantly made some distance between us, I was respectful to her at all times but I told her I needed to go home and process all this information before I could truly have any reaction. On my drive home I started getting really mad - if we hadn't been sexting, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, she doesn't owe me anything. But the fact that we were obviously going to fuck, how could she hide something like that from me and not give me the right to know beforehand? I feel really stupid for having constructed this fairy tale in my head for 2 whole weeks because she didn't bother to tell me this obviously relevant fact. It was a terrible feeling, and to be honest, I'm still really fucking crushed about it. 

&#x200B;

I got home and texted her, thanking her for the date but that I was disappointed  and pissed she didn't tell me before and that it wasn't going to work out. She then proceeded to get angry with me, told me I was being irrational and transphobic and what not. So tell me reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","NTA (Not The Asshole) for being upset and ending things, but YTA (You're The Asshole) for how you handled the situation and your reasoning.

It's understandable that you felt surprised, disappointed, and even betrayed by the lack of disclosure. However, your reaction and subsequent actions were not entirely justified.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the girl's decision not to disclose her trans status earlier was likely due to fear of rejection and potential harm. Unfortunately, trans individuals often face discrimination, violence, and marginalization, which can make them hesitant to disclose their status, especially in intimate or romantic settings.

Your assumption that she should have told you about her trans status before meeting up or engaging in sexting is reasonable, but it's also important to consider the power dynamics at play. As a cis person, you may not fully understand the complexities and risks involved in disclosure for trans individuals.

Your statement that you're not sexually attracted to trans women and that it's ""not your thing"" is a personal preference, and that's okay. However, it's essential to recognize that this preference is not inherently transphobic, but your handling of the situation and communication with the girl could be perceived as such.

When you told her that you needed to go home and process, it's likely that she felt rejected, hurt, and possibly even fearful for her safety. Your subsequent text message, where you expressed disappointment and anger, likely exacerbated these feelings.

The girl's reaction, accusing you of being irrational and transphobic, might be understandable given the context. While it's not okay to accuse someone of being transphobic without justification, it's essential to acknowledge that your actions and words may have caused harm and perpetuated negative stereotypes.

In hindsight, a more empathetic and respectful approach would have been to have an open and honest conversation with the girl about your feelings, boundaries, and expectations. You could have expressed your surprise, disappointment, and concerns in a non-accusatory manner, acknowledging her perspective and experiences as a trans woman.

Remember that relationships involve mutual respect, trust, and communication. While it's okay to have personal preferences and boundaries, it's essential to prioritize empathy, understanding, and respect for the other person's identity, experiences, and feelings.",-0.467

Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her. Once we gave her some anchovy fillets for crackers, etc and they confiscated her lunch, which prompted a big argument between us and the school.

Are we being assholes? I feel like we live in crazy land the hubbub this has started. Over something so stupid.","YTA. While your daughter's lunches are likely healthy, the issue isn't the nutritional value; it's the social appropriateness and practicality for a first-grader.  

Your daughter is six or seven years old.  Even if *you* consider prosciutto and olives ""snack-focused,"" they are far from typical first-grade fare.  Anchovies? Steak?  These are highly unusual lunch choices for that age group.  The school isn't wrong to be concerned about a ""sharing environment.""  A child bringing such unusual food might inadvertently exclude themselves from lunch-time social interactions, even if they aren't directly teased.  The teacher's concern isn't about your parenting style, per se, but the potential for your daughter to feel isolated or different due to her lunch.

The comparison to Lunchables is misleading.  While Lunchables aren't exactly gourmet, they're designed for and accepted by children that age. Your daughter's lunches are significantly outside the norm.  The school's concern is valid.  While confiscating her lunch was extreme, the underlying worry about social integration is legitimate.

Try to compromise.  Offer your daughter some healthier versions of more age-appropriate foods.  Think things like whole-wheat sandwiches with kid-friendly fillings (turkey, ham, cheese), fruits, vegetables, and yogurt.  You can still incorporate some of the healthier elements you prefer, but in a way that's more socially acceptable for her age group.  The goal isn't to force her to eat things she dislikes, but to help her participate more fully in the school lunch experience.  A conversation with the teacher, focusing on collaboration and finding common ground, would be helpful.

I recently purchased a pair of shoes from a friend at a huge discount. The shoes were brand new, albeit too small for him. I decided I would try and make them fit and bought them from him for $50, but after wearing them for a day I discovered they are a half size too small for me. I asked if he would take them back, but he said no. I called the company that makes the shoes and told them that they were still in “like new” condition but that I did not have the original box. The company basically said tough luck and left it at that. 

Now there is an outdoor equipment company that has an incredibly open return policy that I have purchased shoes from before. Their policy is “if it’s within the first year it was purchased then the item can be returned or exchanged with no questions asked” and any returned items are then sold in a Garage Sale style event each quarter. 

My thought process is if I purchase the same shoes in the proper size then return the pair that doesn’t fit would that make me an asshole? The shoes have only ever been worn twice, once by the original owner and once by me, and would be bought by someone else that could use them at the Garage Sale event, and I would have a pair of shoes that fit.

**Backstory:**  My daughter is now 7 years old. After kiddo was born and I went back to work, my mom watched her in the hours that overlapped my SO's and I's jobs. We eventually bought a house around the corner from my parents. My mom's continued to watch kiddo for 3 years. Until my mom got very ill and required surgery. During this time, mom said she was unable to watch her any longer. Sister took over watching kiddo in the overlap. Going into this arrangement, both mom and sister said they didn't need to be paid for this. **However**, I did give them money from my tax return every year and also any extra that I happened to be able to share. I also offered MANY times to put kiddo into daycare, there's a ""by income"" program in our state that would have made daycare affordable. After my sister took over, my mom would take kiddo out once a week for a few hours. Of course, kiddo grew VERY attached to her grandmother and aunt.

**Present**: Shortly after my daughter turned 3,I became fully disabled and unable to work. Over these past few years mom/sis basically ghosted kiddo. The only time they see/talk to kiddo is if I bring her around to them. My dad comes around and sees kiddo on his way home from work whenever he can. The only time mom/sis for sure see kiddo is holidays, which my mom is quick to post any and all pics of kiddo on FaceySpace to show off. 

**Here's what gets me** I've been present more than a few times when a family member or friend comments to my mother/sis how nice it is to have my kiddo right around the corner and they can see her whenever they want and how much time they must get to spend together...etc. When these conversations occur, mom/sis neglect to mention the fact that they go MONTHS without seeing or even talking to kiddo. They're more than happy to agree with whatever the person is saying though.


I'm fed up with it. Don't use my kid to make yourself look better. My kid has cried to me asking why her grandmother/aunt don't like her, why don't they come and see her, why they don't take her anywhere anymore, etc. I try and be as diplomatic as possible, explaining they both have health issues/are busy. Yes, they both have health issues, but neither one's issues are so bad that it would prevent them from seeing kiddo for months at a time. I have attempted to talk to mom/sis MULTIPLE times about spending time with kiddo, but my words fall on deaf ears.


**Would I be the asshole** if the next time someone comments to mom/sis how great it is that we live so close to them, I tell that person that mom/sister don't actually see/talk to kiddo for months at a time?


I have considered the fact that maybe kiddo is unpleasant to spend time with, but I really don't see that as being the case.I get compliments on her from people all the time about what a sweet kid she is and how well behaved she is, she really IS awesome! So I don't think that's it.

I await your judgement!","You're considering calling out your mom and sister for their lack of involvement in your daughter's life, and I'm here to help you decide if that would be a reasonable response.

Firstly, it's understandable that you're frustrated and hurt by their behavior. Your daughter is clearly affected by their absence, and it's not fair to use her as a prop to make themselves look good to others. You've tried talking to them about this issue multiple times, and they've ignored your concerns.

In this situation, I wouldn't say you're the asshole for speaking up. In fact, it's reasonable to correct the narrative and provide a more accurate representation of their involvement in your daughter's life. By doing so, you're not only standing up for your daughter's feelings but also holding your mom and sister accountable for their actions.

However, it's essential to consider the timing and approach. You might want to choose a private moment to discuss this with your mom and sister, rather than calling them out in front of others. This could help prevent unnecessary conflict and allow for a more constructive conversation.

When you do decide to speak up, try to focus on the specific behavior that's causing the issue (i.e., their lack of involvement and using your daughter as a prop) rather than making a personal attack. You could say something like:

""Hey, I've noticed that when people comment on how great it is that we live close to you, you don't always mention that you don't actually get to spend much time with [daughter's name]. I understand that you both have health issues and are busy, but it's been really tough for [daughter's name] to feel like she's not a priority to you. I wish we could find a way to make more time for her, even if it's just a regular phone call or visit.""

By framing the conversation in this way, you're addressing the specific issue and expressing your concerns in a non-accusatory manner.

Remember, your daughter's feelings and well-being are what's most important here. If speaking up helps to create a more honest and open dialogue about your mom and sister's involvement in her life, then it's likely a reasonable response.

So, to answer your question: No, you wouldn't be the asshole for speaking up and correcting the narrative. In fact, it's a necessary step to advocate for your daughter's emotional well-being.",0.333

I am a high school student, and my dad drops me off at school every day, along with my brother. His classes start at 7:30, so we leave at 7:10 to make sure that he gets to school in time, as we have to drop me off first (I would be late if he were dropped off first). If I don't get into the car at 7:10, I will get dropped off in a shopping center close to my school instead of the road next to it, so my brother will still be on time. We have another rule where if someone else is late instead of me (usually it's my fault we are late) I will get dropped off near the school like normal.

&#x200B;

Today, my brother and I got into the car at the same time (7:11), but my dad still said I had to walk. I made the argument that since my brother and I got into the car at the same time we were technically both late, but my dad wouldn't hear any of it. He said that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and my brother was already ready at the time, he just was waiting on my dad and I (my dad started the car around 7:10, and my brother quickly followed; he was getting into the car as I was walking towards it and we shut the doors maybe 5 seconds apart).

&#x200B;

It ended up getting into a big argument with my dad, and later my mom, who admitted that the rules were ambiguous but said I needed to take responsibility for my actions (which I feel I did, but according to her ""I was late, but we closed the door at the same time so we were both late"" is not being responsible). AITA? Thanks.","To determine whether you are in the wrong (AITA), let's break down the situation:

1. **Established Rules**:
   - You and your brother are dropped off at school in a specific order.
   - If you are not in the car by 7:10, you get dropped off at a shopping center.
   - If someone else is late, you get dropped off normally.

2. **Today's Incident**:
   - Both you and your brother got into the car at 7:11.
   - Your dad still dropped you off at the shopping center.

3. **Your Argument**:
   - Since both of you got into the car at the same time, you both were technically late, so you should be dropped off normally.

4. **Your Parents' Perspective**:
   - Your dad and mom believe you should take responsibility for your actions and that the rules are clear.

Given these points, here are a few considerations:

- **Clarity of Rules**: The rules do seem a bit ambiguous. If both of you are late, it's not clear whether the rule applies to the first person to get into the car or both.

- **Responsibility**: Your parents' perspective is that you should take responsibility for your actions. However, if the rules are not clear, it's reasonable to argue that both of you being late should result in a different outcome.

- **Consistency**: If the rule is that the first person to get into the car determines the drop-off, then your dad's decision makes sense. If the rule is that both of you being late means a different outcome, then your argument holds.

Given the ambiguity and the fact that both of you were late, it seems like there might be room for a more flexible interpretation of the rules. However, your parents' insistence on strict adherence to the rules, as they understand them, is also valid.

**Verdict**: It's a bit of a gray area, but you do have a point about the ambiguity of the rules. It might be worth having a family discussion to clarify the rules and ensure everyone is on the same page.

So, **NAH** (Not the Asshole). The situation is more about a misunderstanding of the rules rather than anyone being clearly in the wrong.",0.333

This virus also has a patch online that the developer released so you could decrypt your files without scoring all those points. So if my sister is good enough at Google, her problem will be solved quickly.    

So yeah, it won't affect her much. But it will be annoying as hell for her. Not as annoying as the viruses she installed were, though. WIBTA?","WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) if you infected your sister's PC with a virus? In this case, yes, you would be the asshole. 

While it's understandable that you're frustrated with your sister's lack of caution when downloading files and the consequences that have affected you in the past, intentionally infecting her computer with a virus is not an acceptable solution. 

Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Retaliation is not a constructive approach**: Instead of seeking revenge, it would be more productive to have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns. Explain how her actions have affected you and try to find a way to educate her about online safety.

2. **It's still a harmful action**: Even though the virus you mentioned has a patch available, and it might not cause significant damage, it's still a malicious act that could cause your sister stress and anxiety. 

3. **It could damage your relationship**: If your sister discovers that you intentionally infected her computer, it could lead to trust issues and damage your relationship.

4. **There are better ways to teach her a lesson**: Instead of resorting to harmful actions, you could try to find alternative ways to educate your sister about online safety. You could offer to help her install antivirus software, teach her how to identify suspicious files, or show her how to use a virtual machine to test unknown programs.

5. **You've already taken steps to protect yourself**: Now that you have your own PC, your files are safe. You can focus on maintaining a healthy and secure digital environment for yourself without feeling the need to retaliate against your sister.

In conclusion, while your frustration is understandable, intentionally infecting your sister's computer with a virus is not an acceptable solution. It's better to address the issue through open communication, education, and finding alternative ways to teach her about online safety.",-0.333

I am currently trying to get a new degree while going to school part time. I want to get through and as fast as I can (to save money) and to learn as much as I can.

We have to do a project that consists of 2 parts. A formative one we have to do in groups, and a summative one which is individual. The formative one is to prepare you for the summative one, and as we hand it in we will receive feedback that we can use to do the summative one. 

Naturally, I want to do the best i can on the formative one, so I can get the most constructive feedback to create the best possible summative assignment I can. I was not allowed to choose my teammates.  I got paired with to women who are both not the strongest of the bunch in terms of grades and knowledge, but that is fine, we are there to learn.

We started off working very well together, dividing the tasks and giving each other feedback. Teammate 1 drops a bomb that she’ll be dropping out after december. In her words: ‘’I will try to finish my part, but I can’t give my all anymore, knowing there’s no reward in it for me.’’ Red flags to me, I want good feedback. I tell her so, and offer to take over her part, but she is adamant. Fine.

Teammate 2 just doesn’t understand how to write an essay. She picked a very sketchy source to base her piece on, and then didn’t reference to it in her text, whilst making numerous grammatic errors and leaving out vital structural pieces. I told her this twice. She adjusted it, twice, but it just became different; not better. We calles the teacher over, he explained again to her how it was wrong, and she adjusted it again, wrongly, again. He tried again, pointing out flaws to both teammate 1 and 2, but they didn’t adjust it correctly. I stopped explaining after this.

I took on the task of editing the entire thing together and I saw the monstrosity of an essay. And I completely rewrote the thing. I stayed true to the core of what teammate 2 wanted to say, but used a reliable source, edited wording, grammar, structure and added some stuff. I rewrote teammate 1’s entire piece. New topic even. I feel bad about doing it, but I want to get feedback I can work with instead of ‘’it’s all weird and wrong’’. I can’t work with the feedback on only my part, as teammate 1 and 2 also wanted to take on the introduction and conclusion. 

I feel like it’s a selfish move, but they weren’t getting my or my teacher’s feedback at all, and kept making a mess out of it. I might have robbed them of their opportunity to learn, but feel like they were robbing me of mine. I’m a bit torn. Am I the asshole?","It's understandable that you want to get the most out of your educational experience and that you're frustrated with the situation. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Academic Integrity**: By rewriting your teammates' contributions without their knowledge or consent, you've essentially taken credit for their work, which is a violation of academic integrity. Even if their work was poor, it was still their effort, and they should have been given the opportunity to learn from their mistakes.

2. **Teamwork**: Group projects are designed to teach teamwork and collaboration. By taking over their parts, you've denied them the chance to learn and grow from the experience.

3. **Communication**: You mentioned that you told your teammates twice about the issues with their work, but you didn't communicate your plan to rewrite their parts. This could have led to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.

4. **Feedback**: Even if the feedback on their parts would have been negative, it would have been a learning opportunity for them.

Given these points, it seems like you might be the asshole in this situation. However, it's important to note that your actions were likely driven by a desire to succeed and learn, which is understandable.

In the future, it might be helpful to:

1. Communicate more openly with your teammates about your concerns and plans.
2. Seek help from your teacher or a tutor to improve your teammates' understanding of the material.
3. Focus on your own part of the project and let your teammates handle their own parts, even if they're not doing as well as you'd like.",-0.333

My friend group loves making fun of eachother in a kinda light hearted way. Everyone's got their thing that's like a running joke. (For example, I just got rejected by my crush, and my friends joke about it)

So there is this girl in the group, let's call her CH. She isn't very good at spelling and she's kinda lazy so I just assumed that she didn't feel like correcting her typos in chat. So I made fun of her spelling a lot because it seemed crazy to write things so incorrectly, and it was funny to me. When I made fun of her for it, she laughed at my jokes so I thought that all was well.
But today I was talking about her spelling with two of my friends. One of them, DE, said while listening to us, ""dude ur an asshole. Your making fun of somebody's disability."" And I instantly felt like shit. I didn't know. She then told me that CH confided in her that, she has a ""spelling disability"" (not sure what it's called properly). I was a little bit sceptical about the truth of it, because CH is known to make up dumb shit to fuck with her friends minds. But I believe it to be true because she provided details and such.

I know what I did was kinda shitty, AITA?

Edit: Turns out DE just made that shit up, and CH really is just too lazy to correct her typos.

Edit 2: I spoke to CH about this and she found it hilarious that DE would come up w/ something like that. And she doesn't mind me joking around w/ her about this.","Based on the context you've provided, it sounds like you were initially unaware of the potential disability, and you intended your jokes to be in line with the group's established dynamic of lighthearted teasing. Since CH hadn't communicated any discomfort to you and even laughed at your jokes, it wasn’t clear to you that this might be a sensitive issue.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. **Initial Unawareness**: If you didn't have any information about a potential disability and CH was participating in the banter without showing signs of being uncomfortable, it seems that you acted without malice and within the bounds of your group's joking culture.

2. **Information from DE**: Once you were informed by DE about the potential for a disability, it was understandable and responsible that you felt bad and reconsidered your actions. It shows you were open to adjusting your behavior based on new information.

3. **Clarification**: The situation was later clarified, as DE had fabricated the story about the disability, and CH actually found the entire scenario funny, which suggests that no harm was done in this case.

In light of these factors, it seems like you've acted reasonably given the information you had. Moving forward, it could be valuable to ensure open communication within your friend group about boundaries and any sensitivities to avoid misunderstandings. This situation seems to have been resolved amicably, so it doesn’t sound like you're the asshole here.",0.333

My dad ordered the Uber for me. When he got there, I clearly saw that he was vaping a *lot.* It was an actual vape, not a Juul. He had been waiting outside for maybe ten+ minutes. I told him that I was probably the wrong person and went back inside. My dad yelled at me because clearly he would stop vaping when I went in the car, and vaping is probably odorless anyways, plus I'd made him wait for twenty minutes (it was actually around ten). Still, I ended up taking a different Uber. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: (My conclusion as of 10:56 ET):

**\*ITA for telling him that it was the wrong person \[caused confusion for Uber driver/wasted his time + money\].** I then walked away and called my dad, and my dad told me that ""it was the right Uber, X is my name on Uber"" .... meaning that the man had proceeded to call my dad after I left. I think that there are white lies that are equally effective in this situation - ie, sorry, it *is* me but my friend/family member is picking me up, or something of that nature.

**\*ITAish - should've waited to tell my dad to call the Uber/made it more clear that I wasn't ready \[would've prevented him from waiting\]**. (I texted him: ""I'm at the carousel waiting for luggage, can you wait 5-10 min and call an uber because my Uber isn't working"" at about 6:00, at 6:08 he texted me that the Uber had arrived, and then at 6:12 I asked him where.) My phone died sometime in between, and I probably got to the driver roughly at 6:18. I should've given myself a larger window for this.

**\*ITA for making assumptions about his sketchiness \[he is probably not going to hurt me or anything, which I mostly recognized at the time\].** Had I scheduled the Uber for myself and seen his ratings, I may have felt more comfortable. That is not a good thing imo.

**\*NTA for being uncomfortable \[I do maintain that it is unprofessional to vape ""on the job"", but it's debatable whether or not he was on the job at the moment\]**. I do think that I reserve the right to feel uncomfortable in situations and to exercise my own instinct. I think the ethicality of these situations is determined by my responses, not reactions.

If you have anything else to add, please contribute.","The age-old dilemma of whether to prioritize comfort or convenience!

I think you're making a good case for being both NTA (Not The Asshole) and ITA (In The Asshole) at the same time.

NTA for being uncomfortable and exercising your right to feel uneasy in a situation that makes you feel unwelcome or unprofessional. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to get into a car with someone who's vaping, especially given the concerns around vaping and its impact on health.

ITA for not waiting to talk to your dad about the situation before leaving the driver. You did ask your dad to wait 5-10 minutes, but you also didn't give him a clear heads-up that you weren't ready to get in the car. It's possible that your dad was waiting for you to confirm that it was the right car, and your sudden departure may have caused confusion for the driver and wasted his time.

ITAish for not being more prepared for the situation. You should have given yourself a larger window to account for any unexpected delays or issues with the Uber app. It's also a good idea to have a backup plan in case your phone dies or you're unable to communicate with your dad.

ITA for making assumptions about the driver's sketchiness. While it's understandable that you felt uneasy, it's also important to recognize that the driver was likely just trying to earn a living. It's not necessarily fair to assume that someone is ""sketchy"" just because they're vaping.

Overall, I think you're being reasonable in your concerns and reactions. It's okay to prioritize your comfort and well-being, and it's also important to be mindful of the impact your actions may have on others.",0.333

My best female friend and I have went to elementary, middle, and high school together. We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship. When we were 22 and single, we thought it would be fun to make a pact that if we were both not married by 32, we would get married to each other. We got that idea from a foreign film we saw together. 


We talked about this pact often until she got married when she was 28, had a kid and got divorced two and a half years later. I have had several short-term relationships. I turned 32 in September and her birthday was yesterday. I called her to say happy birthday and mentioned our pact. She said she isn’t ready for this much commitment yet. She talks about her daughter and being busy with work. I told her that I like her daughter and don’t mind taking her in as my own and I’ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. 


I got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it. She says it’s a lot different never having been married than having been married and divorced, that I would never understand her reservations. She says if and when she’s ready to discuss our marriage pact, she will. I told her that’s fine and wished her well. In the meantime, I’m not expecting much out of this marriage pact and will keep dating and finding the one for me.","It's understandable that you might feel annoyed or disappointed, as the pact held significant meaning for both of you at one point. However, it's important to consider a few things:

1. **Life Circumstances Change**: Your friend has gone through a marriage and a divorce, which can significantly alter one's perspective on commitment and relationships. Her experiences have likely shaped her feelings about remarriage.

2. **Time and Priorities**: She has a daughter and a demanding job. These responsibilities can make the idea of remarrying feel overwhelming or not a priority right now.

3. **Communication**: It's clear that you both need to communicate more openly about your expectations and feelings. It's not fair for her to brush off the pact entirely without acknowledging the significance it once held for both of you.

4. **Respect Her Feelings**: While it's valid to feel annoyed, it's also important to respect her feelings and boundaries. Pushing the issue might strain your friendship.

Given these points, it might be best to give her some space and time. Let her know that you respect her feelings and are willing to wait, but also make it clear that you need some closure on the pact. Here are a few suggestions:

- Acknowledge her feelings and the changes in her life.
- Express that you understand her reservations but also that the pact meant a lot to you.
- Ask her if she thinks it's possible to revisit the pact in the future, or if she thinks it's best to let it go.
- Make it clear that you value your friendship and want to move forward in a way that respects both of your feelings.

Ultimately, it's not about who is right or wrong, but about finding a way to navigate this situation that respects both of your feelings and preserves your friendship.",0.2

I (26F) just got off the phone with my mother and she acted like I was being really awful, so I’m looking for some second opinions.

Some background: my parents are well off. My mother is an exec and has been making close to half a million dollars a year. I was lucky enough to graduate from college with no debt in part because they were able to pay the remainder after a generous scholarship + my graduating early. Then I worked for a few years, off of their payroll, but they’ve always been generous with gifts. For example, they’ve still invited me and my brother (22M) on family vacations and they helped me with a down payment on my first apartment.

I'm in my second year at law school, and at the onset my mother generously offered to cover whatever I couldn’t. Well, it turns out law school was a good investment in this case—I’m at the top of my class, and landed a summer associateship next year at one of the top firms in the country. The pay from that summer will fully cover my last year’s tuition, and these kinds of internships often result in an offer at market rate after graduation.

Our family is close, and I’ve always told my mother that I would be happy to do for her + my dad in retirement what she did for me + my brother if I could afford it. But she’s also planned very well for retirement, so there’s never been any expectation that they couldn’t cover their own bills.

Well, out of the blue today while we were on the phone my mom told me that she thinks I should cover the “family” cell account when I’ve graduated. The plan would include parents, my brother (graduating from a prestigious college with an engineering degree this year), and me. I expressed confusion because I figured me + bro would be splitting off after graduation. She kept pushing and making excuses about how it would be “cheaper” to all be together (but it definitely wouldn’t be cheaper for me to cover a $400 plan). I wouldn’t fold. I reiterated to her that I would be trying to restore my savings account and budgeting once I started working since I will have depleted my savings completely and basically earned negative income for three years. Then she started pulling out all of the things she’s paid for in the past and asking when I would pay her back for those, if I wouldn’t “even” cover their phone bill. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t try to cover them if they were in actual financial danger (I told her that), but I don’t want her or anyone else to be planning to spend a salary that I’m not even making yet literally over a year in advance. 

But she sounded so legitimately hurt, like I was just throwing her and my father to the wolves and being ungrateful for what they’ve done for me. I know my life has been MONUMENTALLY easier because of their help. But I’ve been taught to make good financial choices, and it seems like a really dumb one to promise to spend money that I don’t have on someone who makes more than 99% of the country. 

AITA? Should I have just agreed to help?

EDIT: Trying to stay under 3000 characters made this more confusing. First: I haven't lived in the family home since I was 21. I paid my own bills from 21-25. Second: Mother's original arrangement was to put me on family payroll while I'm in law school but deplete my savings + let me contribute as much as possible with summer jobs, then come back off the phone plan (and all of the ""shared"" family accounts) and pay for myself completely once I graduate.","NTA.  Your mother is being unreasonable.  She's wealthy, you've already benefited greatly from her generosity, and you're about to enter a high-paying career.  However, that doesn't obligate you to subsidize her phone bill, especially when she hasn't presented a real financial need.  

Her guilt-tripping and bringing up past expenses is manipulative.  You've been responsible with your finances, and continuing to be fiscally responsible as you launch your career is a smart move.  Sticking to your plan to rebuild your savings is perfectly reasonable.  There's a big difference between being grateful for past help and being financially obligated to your parents indefinitely.  You've already expressed your willingness to help them if they genuinely need it; that's more than sufficient.

It's a big water park, and my wife and I haven't been there since we were kids. We weren't comfortable with our daughter going there with our parents because of how big it is, and the fact that we're unfamiliar with it. It would be fine with us if my mom took her there some day after we've gone to see it and are more comfortable with it.

When I told my Mom this, she was livid. First she said that I'm forcing her to break her promise to my daughter. I told her that she should have asked us if she could take our daughter to the water park before telling our daughter that they were going to go, and made sure we were okay with it, and if she had done that she would have known how we felt about it and wouldn't have promised to her that they would go.

 She also said that this means we don't trust her, but I told her that of course we trust her, we let her take our daughter lots of places. It's not that we don't trust her, it's that we're not comfortable with the water park and we want to check it out first.

Anyway, now my mom is still watching our daughter when we're at work, but she's barely speaking to us, and she's clearly still really pissed a couple of days later.

Your concerns are completely valid and reasonable.  It's your child, and you have the right to set boundaries about where she goes and who takes her.  Your mom overstepped by making plans without your consent, especially given your daughter's anxieties.

While your mom framed it as breaking a promise to your daughter, the promise was made without consulting you, the parents.  The real promise was to *you* to care for your daughter, and that includes respecting your wishes about her activities.  Your mom's reaction is disproportionate to the situation.  She should be prioritizing your daughter's well-being and respecting your parenting decisions, not throwing a tantrum because she can't do what she wants.

The fact that your daughter is afraid of slides and loud noises, and has had a negative experience with a similar water feature, makes your hesitation even more justified.  Your mom dismissing your concerns and claiming she ""knows how to handle"" your daughter's reactions is dismissive and frankly, a little arrogant.  It's not about trust; it's about responsible childcare and understanding your daughter's needs.

Your explanation to your mom was clear and respectful.  Her continued anger is her problem to deal with, not yours.  You handled this appropriately.  Consider having a calm conversation with her later to reiterate your concerns and your need for her to respect your decisions regarding your daughter's care.  However, don't feel obligated to appease her anger.  Your daughter's well-being is paramount.

It's completely understandable that you'd feel embarrassed about public displays of affection (PDAs) in front of your 13-year-old daughter. At this age, kids often start to develop a sense of modesty and may find their parents' affectionate behavior awkward or cringeworthy.

It's not that you're opposed to affection in general, but rather that you're considerate of your daughter's feelings and don't want to make her uncomfortable. It's a normal part of parenting to navigate these kinds of situations and set boundaries that respect your child's growing independence.

Your wife's reaction is understandable, too - she might feel like you're being overly sensitive or that you're not allowing her to express her affection for you. However, it's essential to have an open conversation with her about how you feel and why. You can explain that it's not about not wanting to show affection, but about being mindful of your daughter's feelings and avoiding potentially embarrassing situations.

It's also worth considering that your daughter's laughter might not be just about embarrassment, but also about her natural reaction to seeing her parents being affectionate. It's a normal part of her development to start to differentiate herself from her parents and establish her own sense of identity.

Ultimately, finding a balance between showing affection and being considerate of your daughter's feelings is key. You and your wife can discuss and find a compromise that works for both of you, such as being more mindful of PDAs when your daughter is around or finding other ways to show affection that don't make her uncomfortable.",0.233

TLDR: a friend owes me money and when I asked her for it long after the agreed upon payment date, she ghosted me. So I’m considering taking her to small claims court but other friends think that’s an asshole move.

The long version:  A close friend of mine was trying to grow her business as a horse trainer by purchasing retired racehorses, putting some training on them and selling.

She bought a horse with me in mind as a surprise although I really wasn’t in the market. I ended up buying that horse from her at 4 times what she paid for it and she only put 6-8 rides on him. She also failed to mention that he had ulcers so I’ve spent another 3k on diagnostics and treatment. But it is what it is and I ended up with a great horse and helped her business.

A few months after I bought my horse, she found another prospect but didn’t have the cash to buy him and asked if I would. We discussed and came to the agreement that I’d give her the purchase money, she’d put 30 days on him, sell and pay me back.

That was Feb 2019. Expected turnaround for payment was March/April. 

In April, she filed for divorce and was busy selling her house and moving so wasn’t riding. I understood that time and money were very tight especially given she has kids so I didn’t push.

All summer she vacationed and partied like a 21YO. No riding. I inquired and she said it was “too hot to ride”.

In September I asked about when she was going to get him sold and she told me that her assistant really wanted the horse. Great! Let’s sell!  Only assistant doesn’t have much money and would I just “gift”. Fuck no. I didn’t get a deal on my horse, in fact I paid many times more! And this horse I bought to help her out. Not even asking to split profit. Just wanted the seed money back!  

Last month, she remarried her ex husband and moved again. Still has horse.

I’ve texted and messaged. She wrote back saying that I should be more understanding of their “family circumstances”. 

At this point, she isn’t responding to texts or calls. So I’m thinking about filing in small claims.  I have documentation of the agreement and I feel like I’ve been more than patient.

But....several other people I’ve discussed this with think it would be a total asshole move. She’s been through a lot, etc.

I really don’t want to be a jerk. I just want my money. I’m not wealthy. I keep about 3k in play for rescue, rehab, rehome activities for horses and dogs and friend knows this. I can’t help anyone else til I replenish the fund and I’ve had a lot of unexpected expenses with the horse I bought from her. So I’m just kind of pissed. And I need the money.

So...WIBTA if I took her to court?","NTA.  Your friends are focusing on your friend's personal circumstances and minimizing the fact that she borrowed money and hasn't repaid it, despite repeated attempts to contact her.  That's a serious breach of trust and a financial obligation she agreed to.

While her divorce and remarriage are undoubtedly stressful, that doesn't absolve her of her debt.  You've been incredibly patient, giving her ample time to repay you.  Her lack of communication and the excuse about the ""family circumstances"" is simply unacceptable.  She actively chose to ignore your attempts to resolve this amicably.

You have documentation of the agreement, which is crucial for a small claims case.  Going to small claims court is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate way to recover the money she owes you.  It's not an ""asshole move,"" it's protecting your financial interests after exhausting all other options.  Your friends are putting emotional considerations ahead of a clear financial obligation.

While it's understandable that you might be tempted to let the hacker finish the season pass as a form of ""punishment"" or ""entertainment,"" I'd argue that it's not necessary or justified. Here's why:

1. **It's your account**: The hacker has already done significant damage by accessing and using your account without permission. You've likely lost control over your in-game items, progress, and personal data.
2. **The hacker's actions are unauthorized**: The person has been using your account without your consent, which is a clear breach of trust and potentially a crime.
3. **You have the right to secure your account**: As the rightful owner, it's your responsibility to protect your account and its contents. Changing the password and securing your account is a reasonable step to take.

Letting the hacker finish the season pass might seem like a form of trolling or revenge, but it's not worth the potential risks:

* The hacker might still have access to your account, even if you're letting them finish the season pass.
* You might inadvertently give them more opportunities to exploit your account or steal more of your in-game items.

Instead, consider taking the following steps:

1. **Change your password immediately**: Secure your account by changing your password to a strong, unique one.
2. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**: If you haven't already, enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to your account.
3. **Contact Epic Games support**: Reach out to Epic Games' support team to report the incident and request their assistance in securing your account and potentially recovering any lost progress or items.
4. **Review your account settings**: Take this opportunity to review your account settings, ensure that no unauthorized changes have been made, and update your security settings as needed.

In conclusion, while it might be tempting to let the hacker finish the season pass, it's not worth the potential risks. Take control of your account, secure it, and focus on recovering any lost progress or items. You can always start fresh and earn a new season pass if you choose to continue playing Fortnite.",-0.4

Nobody but me knows about this but I hate her nonetheless. Am I the asshole?","Yes, you would be the asshole in this situation. Your feelings of resentment and hatred toward these women are unhealthy and problematic for several reasons:

1. You're harboring intense negative feelings toward people who didn't actually reject you (by your own admission, you never made a move)
2. Your description includes racist and sexist assumptions about one woman's college life
3. You're expressing entitlement regarding seeing intimate content of someone (""never even got to see her porn pictures"")
4. You're wishing harm on people based on imagined scenarios and resentment

These thought patterns can be harmful to your own well-being and perspective on relationships. Rather than focusing on hatred toward these women, it would be healthier to:

- Work on your own goals and well-being
- Consider speaking with a therapist about these feelings
- Recognize that harboring resentment primarily hurts yourself
- Challenge assumptions you're making about others' lives

Before I state the situation, I'd like to say that this situation would be a last resort. If things get bad enough, I'd of course speak to my sister before making any decisions, but if she refuses, I would most likely do this without consent if the situation calls for it.

A few months ago, my sister impulsively bought a bearded dragon from a PetCo when she found out her friend had one. She barely read any information on keeping a beardie before thinking she was already an expert.

First, she put a young bearded dragon in a cage with sand bedding. Every source I've read stated that sand bedding for young beardie's is a big no-no because they may ingest it and it could block their digestive system. Thankfully he only spent 2 days with the sand before I scooped it out and replaced it.

&#x200B;

She forgets to buy mealworms for him so he would eat only vegetables for weeks on end until she remembers to go to the pet store to pick them up. From what I read, vegetables should only be around 1/3 of their diet, so I know he shouldn't be eating them exclusively when he eats them on days he has actual mealworms to eat as well. Not to mention she forgets to give him fresh water too. There would be days when I would look into his cage and I'd find that his water bowl is bone dry and I'd discover my sister didn't fill his water for days.

&#x200B;

My sister smokes weed in her room, where she keeps his cage. She also brings in friends who end up smoking in her room as well, both weed and cigarettes. The beardie stays there the entire time.

&#x200B;

Very recently, I went into my sister's room in the morning to take him out of his cage for a little and I found his cage completely open and he wasn't inside. My friend found him under a box 5 minutes later and the poor thing was weak, cold, and bloated. I confronted my sister and informed her that she left the cage door open, thinking this was a mistake. She told me that she did it on purpose and she likes it when he gets out so he could explore. In the past, she also told me she lets him fall from high ledges and she doesn't pay any attention to him when he's out of his cage.

&#x200B;

From my own eyes, this poor thing is stressed out in her care. I know currently things may not call for such drastic measures, but it seems like she's becoming a worse owner every day, like she's getting bored of him. I'm worried for this poor thing and I know he would do better in more competent hands, even now, but that doesn't mean I would do this immediately. If things get bad enough, WIBTA?

&#x200B;

(I'm in no way an expert on bearded dragons. I have done my fair share of research on them so I could try to fill in the gaps of his care that my sister fails to fill and that's about it. If any of these situations aren't things that would be a big deal, please say so. I want to be able to make the right call and I don't want to make any mistakes about this.)","What a concerning situation! It's great that you're taking the initiative to research and ensure the well-being of your sister's bearded dragon. I'll provide you with some insights, and you can decide what's best for the animal.

**The current situation:**

1. **Sand bedding:** You're correct that sand bedding is not recommended for young bearded dragons, as it can cause impaction. Replacing it with a safer substrate, like reptile carpet or paper towels, was a good move.
2. **Diet:** A diet consisting only of vegetables for weeks is not ideal. Bearded dragons require a balanced diet that includes protein sources like insects (mealworms, crickets, etc.). Vegetables should make up about 1/3 of their diet, with insects making up the remaining 2/3.
3. **Hydration:** Forgetting to provide fresh water is a significant concern. Bearded dragons need access to clean water at all times.
4. **Second-hand smoke:** Exposing a bearded dragon to second-hand smoke from weed and cigarettes is not recommended. While there's limited research on the specific effects, it's known that smoke can be detrimental to reptiles' respiratory health.
5. **Cage safety:** Leaving the cage door open, intentionally or not, can be life-threatening for a bearded dragon. They can easily get injured or escape.

**Your concerns and potential actions:**

You've noticed your sister's care is deteriorating, and you're worried about the bearded dragon's well-being. If you feel that the situation is becoming critical, it's essential to consider rehoming the animal to a more competent owner.

**Would you be in the wrong if you gave the bearded dragon away?**

In this situation, it seems that the bearded dragon's welfare is at risk due to your sister's neglect and lack of proper care. If you've tried talking to your sister and she's unwilling to improve her care, it might be necessary to consider rehoming the animal.

**Before taking drastic measures:**

1. **Document everything:** Keep a record of the bearded dragon's living conditions, including photos and notes on its health and behavior.
2. **Talk to your sister (again):** Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns and the bearded dragon's well-being. Emphasize the importance of proper care and the potential consequences of neglect.
3. **Explore alternatives:** If your sister is unwilling or unable to care for the bearded dragon, consider finding a new home with someone who is knowledgeable",0.167

I met that dude at the door with a gun, but it scared the crap out of me and made me pretty jumpy for years. I have cameras everywhere, and when I bought my house I specifically and **repeatedly** told my family I didn't want ANYONE outside of extremely close family to know where I lived. I did this, because my father is very nice and attracts clinger ons like nobodies business, and is constantly having to deal with druggy employees that are good people . . .just crazy ones that are homeless, car less, alcoholics that are constantly in and out of jail etc. I'm sure you know the type


Anyway, at about 1:15 A.M. today this dude shows up BLOWING up my doorbell, he rang it like 60 times in a minute and a half period. I saw him on the camera, and he had a little dog with him, so I assumed he was a neighbor or something thinking the dog was mine after finding a stray. 

Before I could get to the front door, he circled around the house and was at the back door. I grabbed a gun (kept  it concealed so he didn't know I had it) and met him at the back door to figure out WTF he was doing.  

It was some guy who worked for my father months and months ago, that I have only met ONCE. My father brought him by house one day for some stupid reason, so now the guy knows where I live. I was extremely leery when I met him the first time, he was pretty shifty, and of course, had to come in side for something and saw that I have big tv's everywhere and all kinds of fancy crap inside. 

He apparently *just got out of jail* today, and was walking across town to ""the house he's working on building"" to sleep, but there's snow on the ground so he was cold and wanted to ""warm up"" in my glassed in porch. I'm not heartless, despite already being EXTREMELY uncomfortable, so I said he could sit there for a bit and warm up, but he needed to head on. He was rambling some **serious** red flag raising nonsense about having to ""pawn some stuff for groceries"" and how everyone he knew robbed him and wronged him,  and how several including his own mother apparently pulled guns on him, and he reeked of alcohol as soon I opened the door. 


An hour and a half later I saw he still hadn't left, so I went out and he was out there watching TV using a space heater I kept out there. I told him again he was going to have to move on, and made him think my mother was in the house getting nervous about him being there and was going to call the cops. 

30 minutes later, I was about to go out and tell him to leave or I was calling the cops,  when I finally saw him leaving. This was at 3, so he was there almost 2 freaking hours. I live alone and don't want random homeless people showing up in the middle of the night. I feel bad for him and his puppy, but come on! This is precisely why I try so hard not to let anyone know where I live. Now I won't be able to sleep the rest of the night because I have to watch the cameras and make sure he's actually gone. I realized after I saw him, that he was the same guy I called the cops on a few months back, because I saw him on the cameras messing around in my yard. I went out last time too, to see who it was but he was already gone by the time I got outside, so I let the cops know a dude was acting funky in the neighborhood. That was already pretty weird, but after a few days I just assumed it was some vagrant passing through, or weird funky salesman or something. 

I feel terrible that I had to make him leave in the cold on a day with snow everywhere, AITA here? I feel like Scrooge. If it had been someone I knew like a friend or something, I would have let them sleep on the couch inside, or if it had even been some of my father's employees that I at least *know* I would have let them sleep in the glassed in porch with the heater. But he just raised *so* many red flags.","NTA (Not The Asshole). Given your past experiences and concerns about safety, it's understandable that you're extremely cautious about who you let into your home, especially at 1:15 AM. The fact that this guy showed up uninvited, rang your doorbell repeatedly, and then circled around to the back door raises significant red flags.

While it's true that you did offer him a place to warm up in the glassed-in porch, and you seemed to be trying to be kind, it's also clear that you were uncomfortable and trying to set boundaries. You told him he needed to leave, and when he didn't, you reiterated that he needed to go. 

It's not about being heartless, but about prioritizing your own safety and well-being. You have every right to feel uneasy about someone you barely know showing up at your home in the middle of the night, especially given his concerning behavior and the fact that he reeked of alcohol.

It's also worth noting that you didn't just kick him off your porch without giving him any help; you did offer him a place to warm up, and you seemed to be trying to encourage him to leave without being too confrontational.

In hindsight, it might have been helpful to offer him some food or a warm drink to take with him, or even to call a local shelter or hotline to help him get back on his feet. However, given the circumstances, it's not unreasonable that you prioritized your own safety and comfort.

Ultimately, you're not obligated to let strangers into your home, especially if you're uncomfortable or feel threatened. Your actions were reasonable given the situation, and you shouldn't feel too guilty about kicking him off your porch.",0.167

Long story short, I (22f) went to a friends house for a party after work last week. My bf and I both work in bars so we work pretty late. At 1am I texted him I was at the party and he sent back a thumbs up. I had intended on getting a taxi home that night as the hostess had said there’d be people there going in the same direction as me. However, this turned out not to be the case. At 4am I texted my boyfriend not to expect me home that night as I was working the next day, a taxi for that distance on my own was too expensive and found it easier to simply crash at my friend’s. Again, he sent back a thumbs up. ‬

The next morning I arrive in to work and pretty soon after starting receive a text from my bf’s close friend (whom he works with) asking me why I didn’t go home. Confused, I reply that my bf knew I wasn’t coming back. He replied that bf lost his phone and actually had no idea where I was as he hadn’t seen my texts. He then curtly asked that the next time I “couldn’t afford” a taxi home, to call him and he’d pay for it. 

This both pissed me off and weirded me out but I put it to one side and replied that that wouldn’t be necessary and that, as no one had contacted me, I’d had no idea bf had lost his phone or was worried about me. He then jokingly replied that I’d done nothing wrong but to make sure to sleep in ‪the same bed as my bf each night. Again, I found this super intrusive and weird on his part but said nothing as I was more concerned about my bf. ‬

Later, after I arrived home I immediately asked my bf about everything and he seemed confused and said that he had seen all my messages and the only issue was that he was annoyed at me for not letting him know about not coming home sooner which is totally fair. 

I told him about his friend’s messages and he seemed even more confused, saying that he simply asked him to tell me he’d lost his phone, nothing more. This seriously pissed me off and I sent a text to the friend telling him never to send me a text like that again without first being sure of all the facts as it had caused unnecessary worry for me and I felt he’d crossed multiple boundaries. This text was sent a week ago and still no reply. I’m happy to move on and be friends but tbh I want an apology first. I feel like the friend was seriously out of line and had no business saying some of the things he said but my bf’s not too bothered by it and says he sees where the friend was coming from. 

Am I overreacting? Do I deserve an apology or AITA?","You are not overreacting, and you do deserve an apology from his friend. Here's why:

1. Lack of boundaries: His friend's messages were intrusive and crossed multiple boundaries. He had no business asking you to sleep in the same bed as your boyfriend or implying that you're not responsible enough to handle your own life.
2. Unnecessary worry: His friend's messages caused unnecessary worry and stress for you, which is unacceptable. You had already informed your boyfriend about your plans, and he seemed to be okay with it.
3. Misinformation: His friend's initial message about your boyfriend not knowing where you were was a lie. He knew your boyfriend had seen your texts, but he chose to spread misinformation to manipulate the situation.
4. Disrespect: His friend's tone was condescending and judgmental, implying that you're not responsible enough to handle your own life. This kind of attitude is unacceptable in a friend or acquaintance.

You have every right to be upset and to demand an apology from his friend. It's not about being overly sensitive or reactive; it's about setting boundaries and protecting your own emotional well-being.

It's also concerning that your boyfriend seems to be taking his friend's side and downplaying the situation. This could indicate that he's not taking your feelings and boundaries seriously, which is a red flag in any relationship.

You should have a calm and respectful conversation with your boyfriend about why you feel this way and how you'd like him to support you in the future.

I don't go around bragging about it ands it took me a long time to accept that I'm skinny and most likely always will be. I love it now but as a teenage and early 20s not so much.

While I understand your frustration and desire to stand up for yourself, I have to say that your response was not the most effective way to address the situation. Here's why:

1. You didn't address the comment directly: Instead of directly responding to her comment about your thinness, you made a snide comment about her weight. This only escalated the situation and made it about her, rather than focusing on your own feelings.
2. You used a personal attack: By implying that she's overweight and needs to diet, you engaged in a personal attack. This is not constructive and can be hurtful.
3. You didn't express your feelings: You didn't take the opportunity to explain how her comment made you feel or why it was hurtful. Instead, you chose to lash out.

That being said, I do understand your frustration. It's unfair that people often feel comfortable commenting on others' bodies, particularly when it comes to weight. It's a sensitive topic, and people should be more mindful of their words.

If you want to address the situation effectively, here's a suggestion:

Next time, try responding with something like:

""I understand that you might be concerned about my health, but comments like that can be hurtful. As someone who's struggled with body image issues in the past, I'd appreciate it if you could focus on more positive and supportive comments.

Fml what kind of mess did I get myself into just by being friends with someone? I’m only 17 ffs","WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) for not meeting up with this internet friend? Absolutely not!

Firstly, it's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about meeting up with someone who has confessed romantic feelings towards you, especially when you don't reciprocate those feelings. It's natural to feel uneasy or uncomfortable in situations like this.

Secondly, it's not your responsibility to make this person feel better or validate their feelings. You've already told them that you don't feel the same way, and that's okay. It's not your job to make them happy or to be their emotional crutch.

Thirdly, it's not your fault that this person has planned their trip around meeting up with you. That's their decision, not yours. You can't control how others behave or what they expect from you.

Lastly, it's not okay for this person to guilt trip you or make you feel bad about not meeting up with them. That's not a healthy or respectful way to behave in a friendship (if you can even call it that). It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries in this situation.

As for the halo effect, it's possible that this person has idealized you in their mind, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to fulfill their fantasy. You're not responsible for someone else's feelings or expectations.

At 17, you're still learning and growing, and it's okay to make mistakes. The most important thing is that you're taking steps to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being.

Don't worry about what this person thinks or says. You've made the right decision for yourself, and that's all that matters. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup, so take care of yourself and focus on your own happiness and well-being.",0.433

The term dame is the equivalent to knighthood in England. Like ""Sir"" Smith. Google it if you dont believe me.

I argued that it wasnt offensive adamantly.
 Am I the asshole ?","The nuances of language and cultural sensitivities!

While it's true that ""dame"" is a title of honor in the UK, equivalent to a knighthood, and is used as a formal courtesy (e.g., Dame Judi Dench), the term's connotations can be complex.

In informal settings, using ""dame"" to describe a woman can indeed be perceived as old-fashioned or even condescending, especially when used in a casual, colloquial way, like ""you're a cool dame."" This is because, as your friend pointed out, the term ""dame"" can evoke the idea of a ""damsel in distress,"" which carries sexist and stereotypical implications.

It's not that the term ""dame"" itself is inherently derogatory, but rather its informal usage can be seen as reducing a woman to a somewhat antiquated, romanticized notion of femininity.

Your friend's reaction suggests that they, at least, interpreted your comment as carrying some of these connotations. It's possible that they didn't take it as a personal attack, but rather as a thoughtless or unaware comment.

Now, Am I The Asshole (AITA)?

In this case, I'd say you're somewhat the asshole (YTA) for not listening to your friend's concerns and being adamant that the term wasn't offensive. While your intentions might have been good, your inflexibility and refusal to consider your friend's perspective might have made them feel like you weren't taking their feelings seriously.

If you take away one thing from this conversation, it's that language is complex, and words can have different meanings and connotations in different contexts. Being open to feedback and willing to learn about potential sensitivities can go a long way in building stronger, more empathetic relationships with your friends.

So, next time, you might consider being more receptive to concerns about language and taking a moment to understand where your friend is coming from. Who knows, you might learn something new, and your friendships might become even stronger!",-0.333

My Younger sister recently told me that my dad wanted to know why I didn't talk to him and really wishes to be a part of my life. I told her that I'm open to it, but I'm not going to be the first to reach out. I feel like I deserve an apology because he was indifferent to me growing up and I don't feel like I should have to be the one to begin to mend things over. She feels like I should make the first move.

Backstory:

Me and my Dad don't have much of a relationship. He was in and out of my life for the first four years and my grandmother raised me until I was 7 and we all moved in together. Even during that time, It was never quite positive. I was the eldest kid of three and my dad remarried.  Because of this, my two younger siblings often got preferential treatment growing up. They would often argue, fight with other kids and even steal and rarely were  grounded but I'd be treated like a menace if I did so much as not sweep the floor to their liking. I remember once, after Visiting my biological mom for a week or two, my dad ground me for a week for just about no reason. Every time I'd  try to confide in him, or ask for advice, He'd berate me at best or bring it up at some point later on to make fun of me if I annoyed him.

Even as I got older, he never really invested much time in me; I was great in choir and in just about every concert I'd have a solo. Despite this, he'd just drop me and my grandmother off and go home and watch TV.  It kinda hurt being praised by so many strangers but my own father couldn't care less. I even won a free trip to DC once because I won a Japanese language speaking contest and he was more interested in figuring out how my clothes got into his hamper.  Growing up it was always this. Any good thing I'd do he'd ignore but if I slipped up he'd have a field day and wouldn't let it go for weeks.  He called me a Failure at 15 for not having a job, and once I did, charged me rent. And the rent didn't go to anything responsible, like a college fund. I asked him and he laughed at me... It just went to my stepmom's pocket.

 The final straw that broke the camel's back was back when I was 23 and going through a rough patch. I won't go into detail but I was teetering on homelessness and barely eating. I asked him for $40 for food out of desperation, and he said he didn't have it. I found out days later that he flew out to Michigan first class and stayed at an expensive hotel for a vacation.

Despite this, I recently borrowed my stepmom(his wife) $750 to get her car out of repossession. Only reason I did that was because she was helping out my younger sister with rides to her work and she has a young child. I'm not sure if I'll ever actually get it back. It was the first time any one of them has called me in probably two or three years.

There's plenty of other stories but I feel like this gives a good overview of our relationship. So, AITA for feeling like I shouldn't have to be the one to reestablish communications?","NTA (Not The Asshole). Your feelings and expectations are completely justified given the history you've shared. It's understandable that you want an apology and recognition of his past behavior before taking the initiative to reconnect.

Your dad's indifference and preferential treatment towards your younger siblings, combined with his lack of emotional support and investment in your life, have likely caused significant emotional pain and damage. It's reasonable that you don't feel like you should have to be the one to initiate reconciliation.

By saying you're open to reconnecting but not taking the first step, you're setting a boundary and communicating that you expect him to take responsibility for his actions and make amends. This approach also allows him to demonstrate his commitment to changing and improving your relationship.

Your sister's perspective might be influenced by her own experiences and relationship with your dad, which may be different from yours. However, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and needs in this situation.

It's also worth noting that you've already taken a significant step by helping your stepmom with her car issue, which shows that you're willing to help and support your family members, even if it's not directly with your dad. This act of kindness might be seen as a positive step towards rebuilding relationships, but it's not necessarily a requirement for you to initiate contact with your dad.

Ultimately, you have the right to decide how and when you want to reconnect with your dad. If he genuinely wants to be a part of your life, he should be willing to take the first step and make amends for his past behavior.",0.4

Ok so I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with one girl now, used to be two but one left (THANK GOD) and the other stayed.

BoTh of these girls are slobs to the point of leaving trash to pile up and make the apartment smell like garbage and dishes in the sink to the point that if anything else was put in the sink there would be an avalanche of moldy dishes everywhere, trust me, its happened, and they just stayed on the floor.

I'm not perfect. I'm a bit of a mess myself, but there is a difference between being messy and being disgusting. I may not be able to see the surface of my desk due to school and art supplies, but I know when to take out the trash and how to do my own dishes.

I don't live in my apartment during the summer due to a better paying job back home but I come up every once and a while to check on the place and get away from my mother. Its always a fucking mess.

Garbage bags everywhere, pizza boxes everywhere, sink FULL of dishes and gnats just chilling on every surface due to the level of filth that the bitch had left.

I clean it all.

I throw away most of the plastic dishes that were in the sink due to the level of nastiness that covered them. Think that gross algae stuff that grows in stagnant ponds. That, but worse.

I cleaned the kitchen from top to bottom, something that hadn't happened since I stopped using it due to the pigs that I lived with.

Then, I looked in the fridge.

You wouldn't have been able to fit a bottle of water in that fridge it was so full. It also stank like something died in it.

I cleaned it, top to bottom, and threw out everything that wasn't alcohol and wasn't out of date and moldy.

Everything else went in the trash. Pizza boxes, take out containers, tupplewear, milk that had been in there since may, eggs that had been in there for a VERY long time, and 7 MORE pizza boxes went into 4 trashbags that got chocked FULL by nothing but shit from the fridge.

It took me 4 trips to take all the garbage to the dumpster, and I have a 4th floor apartment and its over 100 degrees every day. My legs and arms were SCREAMING after all those stairs.

I then proceeded to clean the fridge, top to bottom, and didn't stop until the thing smelled only of lemon and bleach.

I put the 3 things that I deemed ok to stay.

An unopened bottle of red powerade that I later drank because there was nothing else and I felt as though I deserved it for all the hard work I just did to clean the apartment, some beer and wine coolers, and a tub of butter were all that I put back in the fridge.

Fast forward a few days, I get a nasty call from my roommate asking why I had thrown out all of her food. I told her that what I threw out was either moldy or out of date.

She said that I was a bitch for touching what wasn't mine and that she had bought all that food the week before. I call bullshit.

So, am I the asshole for cleaning the fridge that smelled like death?","Based on the information you've provided, it seems like you were not the asshole in this situation. Here's why:

1. **Health and Safety**: The fridge was so dirty and smelly that it posed a health risk. Food that has gone bad can cause food poisoning and attract pests.

2. **Shared Space**: You all share the apartment and the fridge. It's not fair that your roommate's negligence affected the living conditions for everyone.

3. **Communication**: While it would have been ideal to communicate with your roommate before throwing out the food, given the state of the apartment and the fridge, it seems like you were dealing with an urgent health and hygiene issue.

4. **Roommate's Claims**: It's hard to believe that all the food was bought the week before, given the state of it. It's more likely that your roommate was just upset about losing food they didn't want to admit was spoiled.

However, in the future, it might be helpful to:

- Communicate with your roommate about the state of the apartment and the fridge.
- Give them a chance to clean up or remove spoiled food before you do it yourself.
- Document the state of the apartment and the fridge with photos, in case there are disputes later.",0.333

&#x200B;

all her friends and mine are calling me assholes for doing that to the girl i like i never even liked her","The drama of high school romance!

To determine if you're the asshole (AITA) in this situation, let's break it down:

**Your history with Elissa:**

* Elissa confessed her feelings to you, and you told her you don't have feelings for her.
* You then used her as motivation to lose weight, which is a pretty cool transformation ( congrats on the 30 kg weight loss, btw!).

**Your interest in Michelle:**

* You had a crush on Michelle, but she rejected you due to your weight.
* You worked hard to lose weight, and now you're interested in her again.

**The party incident:**

* Elissa invited you to a party, and you asked if Michelle would be there.
* You flirted with Michelle, and she seemed interested.
* You kissed Michelle, and Elissa saw it, got upset, and left the party.

Now, to answer the question: AITA?

While it's understandable that you didn't have feelings for Elissa initially, you did lead her on a bit by being friendly and accepting her confession without being clear about your lack of interest. However, your main mistake was attending the party with Elissa, knowing she had feelings for you, and then kissing her friend in front of her. That was a thoughtless and hurtful move.

Here's the thing: even if you didn't feel the same way about Elissa, you should have considered her feelings and been more empathetic. You knew she liked you, and you still chose to pursue her friend in a way that humiliated her.

In this situation, many people would consider you the asshole (YTA) because:

1. You hurt Elissa's feelings, even if you didn't intend to.
2. You prioritized your interest in Michelle over Elissa's feelings.
3. You didn't communicate clearly with Elissa about your intentions or feelings.

However, it's also worth noting that you're 15, and you're still learning about relationships, boundaries, and empathy. It's a tough situation, and you've likely learned a valuable lesson.

So, to summarize: YTA, but with some mitigating circumstances. Take this as an opportunity to reflect on your actions, consider the feelings of those around you, and strive to be more thoughtful in the future.",-0.333

This morning I walked right into the principals office and demanded to know why they were giving my daughter condoms in sex Ed (as well as why they’re teaching her about oral and anal sex other more advanced topics that are age inappropriate).

The principal insisted that I leave immediately and to instead send a letter if I feel so strongly against “proper sex education”. She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.

Guys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.","YTA.  While it's understandable to be concerned about the content of your child's sex education, your approach was completely inappropriate.  Bursting into the principal's office and demanding answers is not the way to address your concerns.  A calm and respectful letter expressing your concerns would have been far more effective.

The school likely has a curriculum designed to provide age-appropriate sex education, and while you may disagree with the specifics,  the fact remains that many experts believe comprehensive sex education, including information about various sexual acts and safe sex practices, is important for children's health and well-being.  Condoms are a part of safe sex practices, and providing them isn't necessarily promoting sexual activity; it's about harm reduction if a child chooses to engage in sexual activity.

The school resource officer's comment is irrelevant; he's not an educator or administrator and his opinion on how you should handle the situation doesn't change the fact that you acted inappropriately.

Instead of focusing on your anger, consider calmly discussing your concerns with the school administration through proper channels.  If you remain unsatisfied, you can explore alternative options, but escalating the situation with a disruptive outburst was not the right course of action.

We do have a lot of homeless and a lot of drug addiction in the area. And outside of downtown our neighborhood has the highest police calls.
Because of this when ever our one dog barks at people in the front yard we don't discourage it. 
Now where I might be an asshole is my dog is truly a beast when she barks. She's a pittbul/Rottweiler mix and her hackles rise and she scares the shit out of people.
She's completely fenced in, there's no way she's getting out. She actually listens really well so when I call her she immediately stops and comes running back. And I always call her back when I see who she's barking at.
I've had random dudes all in black with their hoods up get the piss scared out of them and then start yelling and calling me an asshole.
I've also had her bark and scare the shit out of a Muslim mom and her kids.

Tldr: aita for letting my dog bark and scare people?","The age-old debate about whether to let your dog defend your property or not!

While I understand your concerns about the neighborhood and the potential threats, I have to say that your approach might not be the most effective or responsible one. Here's why:

1. **Fear and intimidation are not effective deterrents**: While your dog's barking and aggressive behavior might scare off some people, it's unlikely to deter serious criminals or individuals who mean harm. In fact, it could even escalate the situation, making things worse.
2. **You're creating a hostile environment**: By allowing your dog to bark and scare people, you're creating a hostile environment for your neighbors, visitors, and even your own family members. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, fear, and even legal issues.
3. **It's not a long-term solution**: As you mentioned, you've only had the dogs for three months, and it's unlikely that they'll remain effective at scaring people off forever. Additionally, there are many other ways to secure your property and protect yourself without relying on your dog's barking.
4. **You're not teaching your dog responsible behavior**: By encouraging your dog to bark at people, you're not teaching her responsible behavior or socialization skills. This can lead to behavioral problems and difficulties in the future.
5. **There are other ways to protect your property**: Consider investing in security cameras, motion-sensitive lights, and other deterrents that won't put people or animals at risk. You can also work with your neighbors to create a safer, more cohesive community.

That being said, I'm not saying that you're entirely in the wrong. It's understandable that you're concerned about your safety and the safety of your property. However, I do think that there are more effective and responsible ways to address these concerns.

Perhaps consider the following:

* Work with your partner to develop a comprehensive security plan that includes multiple layers of protection.
* Invest in training and socialization for your dogs to help them become well-behaved and well-adjusted.
* Focus on building positive relationships with your neighbors and the community to create a safer, more supportive environment.
* Consider seeking advice from a professional dog trainer or security expert to help you develop a more effective and responsible approach.

Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

His reaction to your refusal is hypocritical given his own behavior. He regularly demonstrates that he doesn't prioritize plans with you, yet he became upset when you wouldn't cancel family plans for him. The fact that he got angry when you suggested rescheduling rather than accommodating his last-minute invitation shows a lack of respect for your time and commitments.

It's great that you enjoy giving people attention and making them feel valued, but it's essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions. By being overly affectionate and available, you may be creating unrealistic expectations about the depth of your relationships.

While you don't expect much in return, others may interpret your behavior as a sign of close friendship or emotional investment. When you eventually move on, it's natural for them to feel upset or angry, as they've developed an emotional attachment to you.

It's not about being ""disposable"" or ""lesser than"" others, but rather about being aware of the impact your actions have on those around you. Your friends may not realize that you're not emotionally invested in the relationship, and that's where the confusion arises.

To avoid hurting others or creating false expectations, consider being more mindful of your behavior and boundaries. You can still be a kind and caring person without leading others on or creating unrealistic expectations. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Be more intentional with your attention**: While it's great that you enjoy giving attention, make sure you're not overdoing it. Be more selective about who you invest your time and energy in.
2. **Communicate your boundaries**: Let your friends know that you value your relationships, but you also need space and time for yourself. This can help prevent misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations.
3. **Be honest about your emotional investment**: If someone asks you about your feelings or the depth of your relationship, be honest and open with them. This can help prevent misinterpretations and hurt feelings.
4. **Respect others' feelings**: When you do decide to move on, be kind and respectful of the other person's feelings. Acknowledge their emotions and show empathy, even if you're not emotionally invested in the relationship.

Remember, being a good friend or acquaintance is not just about giving attention, but also about being respectful, empathetic, and considerate of others' feelings. By being more mindful of your behavior and boundaries, you can build healthier and more meaningful relationships.",-0.367

My wife went out clubbing with her girlfriends and got shit faced. It makes me uncomfortable when my wife goes clubbing, but since it's something I will never do, I don't try and stop her from going by herself.

Last night I was awoken by her drunk calling me at 2am asking me to pick her up. I asked her where she was and she was a 30minute drive away at least, so 1hr there and back. I just told her to stay with one of her friends and hung up, went back to sleep.

I was awoken the next morning with the most crazed screaming I have ever heard. Apparantly it's my responsibility as her husband to pick her up after a night of drinking regardless the time/location. I disagree, if she's going to go clubbing, she can organise a fucking uber.

Anyway AITA?","Based on your description, I think there's some fault on both sides, but you were the asshole in this situation.

When your spouse calls you at 2am needing help, it's generally expected that you'd try to help them get home safely, even if it's inconvenient. This is typically part of the mutual support expected in a marriage. Your wife was in a vulnerable state (intoxicated, late at night) and reached out to you specifically.

While it would have been reasonable to be annoyed or to discuss better planning for future nights out, simply hanging up on her and going back to sleep without ensuring she had a safe way home showed a lack of concern for her wellbeing. You didn't mention checking if she had money for an Uber or confirming she had a safe place to stay.

That said, your wife should take responsibility for planning her transportation in advance when going out drinking. A conversation about expectations when either of you goes out would be beneficial.

In the future, consider her safety first, then have a calm discussion about planning and boundaries when both of you are sober and calm.",-0.5

Basically I went on a group date with my youth group from church but I agreed to sneak off with this guy Tristan who I’ve had a crush on since we were little. I had a massive stomach ache and I shouldn’t have gone out at all but I wanted the chance to maybe kiss Tristan so I went anyways. We walked into the park across the street from the mall and as soon as we sat down on the swings I farted so loud. Tristan went from being really nice to a total jerk and said he was afraid of being in the park and was afraid of his parents getting him in trouble for sneaking off. It had been his idea in the first place. When we got back he just went with the boys and ignored me. He didn’t call me an asshole but I sure feel like one.

Tristan's reaction is immature and frankly, unkind.  He's the one who suggested sneaking off, and his response to a completely natural occurrence is ridiculous. He's shown himself to be more interested in avoiding potential consequences than in being a decent human being.  Don't let his behavior define your self-worth.

Your family is being incredibly insensitive.  While it's understandable that they might find the situation humorous (though their teasing is over the line), they should be supporting you, not making fun of you.  Talk to your mom again, and let her know how much their teasing is hurting you.  Maybe she can help them understand that this wasn't a deliberate action on your part and that you need their empathy, not their mockery.

Focus on taking care of yourself.  This is a minor incident that doesn't reflect your value as a person. Don't let Tristan's immaturity or your family's teasing ruin your self-esteem. You deserve better.

I brought up that I was hurt because I felt excluded for several reasons, one of them being that they knew I was coming home in August. They then decided to hold a bbq 2 weeks before my arrival, invite all the family, and he proposed then. 

They were under the impression I knew, and admitted to fucking up with telling me about the plans of them doing a destination wedding. They said it was just going to be the two of them, then do the reception in our hometown. I brought up there's an issue with the reception in the hometown because it's so last minute I may not be able to attend as I live in another province. 

Later that night, I get a call saying they called everyone (my boyfriend included) and that they're willing to fly everyone out to Jamaica and if no one can make it then they won't go. Everyone said they were able to make it, so it was up to me whether or not everyone goes. 

I processed it for a few days and deep down felt very uneasy about this as I'm already taking 2-week vacation a week after the wedding (my vacation was planned 7 months ago, this wedding was planned last week), and I'm taking 5+ weeks off medical leave due to surgery. 

The fact that my dad is expecting me to jump in and out of work so freely, I believe is unfair. They're all legitimate reasons but my work has gone beyond and above to accommodate me. To add on several more days of vacation days due to my family's lack of planning seems to be an unfair request. 

I've only been there for a year, and with all the budget cuts, I shouldn't be fucking around with my job because they can easily lay me off and keep someone who has been more reliable for the team. Even if they gave the go-ahead, I believe there will still be covert consequences in regards to how the team sees me. 

I put high importance on my job as I worked very hard to get where I am, and finding another job in the field would be extremely hard, and I also am unable to afford being unemployed or working for lesser wage due to the rising cost of living. I don't have anyone else who would be able to catch me if I fall. All I have is myself. 

My other option is to push my surgery another 6 months, which is difficult in terms of my mental health and I've already gone through weeks of precipitory anxiety and have already put so much energy into preparing myself, preparing my new temporary job position, and just preparing life for those 5 weeks or so. 

Called my father last night, he told me im selfish and ruining the wedding. They don't want anything to do with me if I don't attend this wedding, and they said they're still flying everyone out regardless if I can't go. 

Am I being the asshole in this situation? Or do the options seem unfair?

Edit to add: at this point I don't care if they do the wedding in Jamaica and the reception in our hometown. I'll spend the $600 to fly out for one night if that's what will make them happy, but at this point that does not seem to be an option for them anymore.
Everything was so fast, and I regret that I had originally shared my feelings of being hurt","NTA (Not The Asshole). 

Your father's lack of planning and communication is staggering. He informed you of the wedding less than a week ago, and then expected you to drop everything to attend. The fact that he proposed at a family BBQ and didn't even consider including you in the planning process is hurtful and exclusionary.

Your concerns about work and your upcoming surgery are valid. You've had your vacation and medical leave planned for months, and it's not reasonable to expect you to change your plans on short notice. Your job security and financial stability are important considerations, and it's not selfish to prioritize them.

Your father's reaction to your decision is also unreasonable. Calling you selfish and ruining the wedding is not a constructive or supportive response. It's clear that he's not considering your perspective or feelings.

It's also worth noting that your father's willingness to fly everyone out to Jamaica, except for you, is a red flag. It suggests that he's not willing to make an effort to include you or accommodate your needs.

You offered to fly out for a night to attend the reception in your hometown, but it seems that's not an option for him anymore. It's possible that he's more interested in having a dramatic, emotional moment with the rest of the family than in actually including you.

Overall, you've handled this situation with care and consideration, and it's not your fault that your father's planning was so poor. You don't owe him an apology or a change of heart.",0.467

Ugh. My grand daughter is in second grade ( in America) and in a public school that is ALWAYS sending crap home with the kids to sell to “ raise money” for the school????

It’s ALWAYS something that they have her selling. Valentine’s Day crap, easter crap, christmas crap, thanksgiving crap, random crap. 

They send catalogs home with the kids which falsely advertise this junk making it look fancy in the pictures but when you finally get the crap, it looks nothing like the picture or it’s already broken. This crap is not cheap either. Everything ranges from 20 dollars and up. The cheapest thing is like a tiny box with 4 tiny peanut butter cups in it for 20 dollars. I bought a 50 dollar necklace from her Christmas catalog full of crap and it was delivered all knotted up and couldn’t even be used. 

The final straw was a 2020 calendar which I purchased for 30 dollars which turned out not to even be a real calendar, it was a raffle ticket that I bought to enter to win a calendar. 

I told my daughter that was the final straw and she needs to stop hassling me to buy this shit because it’s not cheap and it’s all garbage. 

My daughter was upset and she said it was the least I could do to show support to my grand daughter by buying this shit and she said that I am not being a good grandmother. 

AITA?","NTA (Not The Asshole). It's completely reasonable to set boundaries and refuse to buy overpriced, low-quality items from your grand daughter's school. The fact that the school is constantly sending home catalogs and expecting parents and grandparents to purchase these items can be overwhelming and financially burdensome.

You've had personal experience with the poor quality of these items, and it's not unfair to say that you don't want to waste your money on them. The example of the $50 necklace that was delivered knotted and unusable, and the $30 ""calendar"" that was actually a raffle ticket, are particularly egregious.

It's also important to note that supporting your grand daughter doesn't necessarily mean buying every item that the school sends home. You can show your support and love for her in many other ways that don't involve wasting money on overpriced junk.

Your daughter's expectation that you should buy these items simply to show support is unrealistic and unfair. It's okay to say no and set boundaries, especially when it comes to your own financial decisions. You're not being a bad grandmother by refusing to buy these items; you're being a responsible and sensible one.",0.533

I have been married to a wonderful man for over a decade. When we first started discussing marriage, I said up front I am not into jewelry and not to spend a lot on an engagement ring. I really only saw myself ever wearing a simple wedding band and a big rock on my finger just wasn't me. But for whatever reason, he still went for a nice ring with a beautiful, quality diamond. It is a beautiful ring, but I only wore it for the 6 months we were engaged, and then when we got married I only wore my wedding band after that. I just find it more practical, it doesn't have a diamond sticking up that can catch on things, and it is a less flashy ring, and just more ""me"" style-wise. I maybe pull my engagement ring out of the safe once a year if we go somewhere nice and get dressed up and even then it is only because my husband suggests I wear it.

Now this ring was given with love but I truly feel more sentimental about my wedding ring than the engagement ring. WIBTA if I suggested to my husband that this engagement ring (probably worth at least 5K) is wasted sitting in a safe 99% of the time and we could sell it and put the money towards something else (mortgage, car loan, family vacation, etc.)? We are not struggling financially, but I we are also pretty practical people who don't spend wastefully either. This ring might have been the biggest exception to that.



1. the value of the ring is not 5k. 5k is what we could probably get for selling it (well the diamond, really). The original price was way more.

2. The ring was bought on credit with a down payment by my husband, and I paid MORE than half of the ring off at the time when we combined finances.

3. The ring is not symbolic to my husband. He didnt want to look like a cheapskate (and wasnt sure I really meant it when I said to buy something cheap) so he spent way more than he should have. He is not upset that I never wear it. He never wears his ring either. He knows the wedding ring is the meaningful one to me. For our anniversary he had our kids birthstones set into it because I wear that one every day.","NTA.  You've been incredibly upfront and honest about your feelings towards jewelry, and your husband knows this.  The fact that he bought a more expensive ring than you both agreed upon doesn't negate your feelings about it now.  Since the ring holds little sentimental value for you, and you've both contributed to its purchase, selling it and using the money for something you both need or want is perfectly reasonable.

The fact that you've paid more than half of the credit off also strengthens your case.  This was a joint purchase in a practical sense, even if the initial decision was his alone.  The sentimental value is clearly with the wedding ring, which you wear daily, and your husband doesn't even wear his ring either.  His lack of upset about you not wearing the engagement ring confirms that the ring's monetary value is far more relevant than its symbolic value to either of you.

Approach the conversation with your husband carefully and lovingly.  Frame it as a practical solution to utilize an asset that isn't serving its purpose.  Focus on the shared benefit of using the money for things you both value, rather than on the act of selling the ring itself.  Your transparency and prior communication about your preferences should make this conversation much easier.

Backstory: I've worked at my hotel for about a year and half, a year of it as the Front Desk Supervisor. Its rather small hotel so every department (Managers, Front Desk, Housekeeping, Maintenance) all know each other and get along for the most part. My work does a lot for employee appreciation things like monthly lunches and giving kudos to those who work hard. Usually when we know its someones birthday, we get a card and have everyone sign it and maybe even a cake if its someone who has been there awhile/is in a management position. 

When I say we, I mostly mean me because I am the one who keeps track of employee birthdays and organizes the getting the card and such. 

My birthday was a week ago today and I know that my coworkers/managers knew it was my birthday because I had requested off the weekend after to do something for it and I had some coworkers ask if I could work a certain day that I had already requested off. 

So the Monday before my birthday, I told myself I wasn't going to say anything to anyone all week about my birthday because I wanted to see if anyone would remember and at least get a card like I always do for everyone else. 

They didn't. 

Come Thursday (my birthday), I'm at work and everything is normal; no Happy Birthdays or anything. My manger, who is one of the nicest people in the world and I considered an actually friend, doesn't even say anything. He even asked me if I could cover the audit shift (11pm-7am) because he didn't schedule someone to cover the auditors request off. 

When I tell him no, I can't do it, I could tell he was kind of annoyed and asked ""Well why not?""

""Because its my birthday and I had it requested off for over a month""

Him- ""........OH SHIT, yeah its your birthday!....uh well...when you come in on Monday we'll have something for you!!"" 

&#x200B;

So I left work that day not really upset, just kind of like let down. But I told myself they would make it right on Monday and I'd at least get a card. 

&#x200B;

Monday of this week comes and nothing.

 Literally nothing. 

Not even a ""how was your birthday weekend?!"" -\_-

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say I was hurt, but definitely disappointed because I usually make a big deal about other employee's birthdays and just wanted them to do the same for me. 

&#x200B;

Then its Wednesday, which is the Housekeeping Supervisors birthday. Now I did know it was her birthday but I honestly forgot about it. 

But when my manager comes to me and is like ""I forgot its so and so's birthday today, can you get a card and cake from the store?"" 

I just looked at him and flat out said ""No, I'm not doing that."" And he, again, looks at me all annoyed and just walks away. Now the housekeeper supervisor told my manger today that she was upset we didn't do anything for her and he kind of put the blame on me for that....

&#x200B;

Am I the Asshole?   

&#x200B;","You're not the asshole. In fact, you have every right to feel disappointed and let down by your coworkers and manager. You've consistently gone out of your way to organize birthday celebrations for others, and it's reasonable to expect the same courtesy in return.

Your manager's response to forgetting your birthday was particularly disappointing. Instead of apologizing and making a genuine effort to celebrate your special day, he brushed it off and promised to do something on Monday, which never happened. This lack of follow-through and consideration is not only unprofessional but also hurtful.

When your manager asked you to organize a birthday celebration for the Housekeeping Supervisor, you were justified in refusing. You had already been disappointed by your own birthday being ignored, and it's unfair to expect you to go out of your way to celebrate someone else's birthday when your own was neglected.

It's also rich that your manager is now blaming you for not doing anything for the Housekeeping Supervisor's birthday. This is a classic case of deflection and lack of accountability. Your manager should take responsibility for forgetting your birthday and not following through on their promises, rather than shifting the blame onto you.

Overall, you're not the asshole for not caring about your coworker's birthday after being ignored on your own. You're simply standing up for yourself and expecting the same level of respect and consideration that you've consistently shown to others.",0.433
