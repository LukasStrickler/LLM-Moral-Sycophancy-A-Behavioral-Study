My stepmom is handicap and can't really move, plus she just had eye surgery so she can't see, so I wanted to tell him to clean my room cause I knew she would if she could, but I never told him to and cleaned it myself.

If you're wondering how I live with a stepmom and a stepdad, it's very complicated.","You're wondering if you would be in the wrong (WIBTA) for telling your stepdad to clean your room, given the circumstances. 

It's understandable that you might feel frustrated and overwhelmed, especially with the dog causing a mess and your stepmom being unable to help due to her health issues. However, it's likely that telling your stepdad to clean your room might not be the most effective or respectful approach.

Considering your stepdad did inform you about the mess, it's possible he was expecting you to take care of it, as it is your room. While it's thoughtful of you to consider your stepmom's situation and willingness to help if she could, it's essential to communicate your needs and expectations clearly with your stepdad.

In hindsight, it's great that you took the initiative to clean your room yourself. This shows that you're responsible and willing to take care of your space.

If you're looking for ways to handle similar situations in the future, you might consider having an open and honest conversation with your stepdad about your expectations and needs. You could say something like, ""Hey, I appreciate you letting me know about the mess in my room. I'd really appreciate it if we could work together to find a solution, or if you could help me come up with a plan to prevent this from happening again in the future.""

Firstly, she steals money from him and makes him spend all of his money on her. He doesn't have a job so most likely it is his parents money he is spending. Secondly, she is taking advantage of him by having him buy cigarettes for her because she legally can't. Third, she makes him babysit her toddler sister and baby niece everything they are together.

It seems like she is taking advantage of him in several ways, which is concerning.

Given your friend's age, the fact that his parents have asked you to protect him, and the impressionable state he might be in, it's commendable that you're looking out for him. It's important to support your friends, but it's equally important to be honest with them and help them make informed decisions.

In this case, you might want to approach the situation delicately. Instead of outright refusing to take the pictures, you could express your concerns to your friend in a non-judgmental manner. You could tell him that you've noticed some behaviors from Becky that worry you and that you think he deserves better. Encourage him to communicate with her about his feelings and set boundaries if necessary.

By approaching the situation in this way, you can help your friend without being an asshole.

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn’t feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I’m not an asshole, and they’re family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It’s not something I’m going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they’ve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can’t help feeling upset over being re-neged on. 

So, Reddit, Am I The Asshole for expecting payment for my emotional labor?","NTA (Not The Asshole). You provided a significant service to your family, putting your life on hold for a week to care for your sibling and provide emotional support. While it's understandable that you might have initially agreed to do it for free because of your family ties, your parents explicitly offered to pay you for your time and efforts.

It's reasonable to expect compensation for the emotional labor involved in caring for a family member, especially when it's a significant time commitment like a whole week. Emotional labor can be just as draining and valuable as physical labor, and it's not something that should be expected to be done for free.

Your parents' decision to only offer payment for the small tasks you completed around the house and not for the emotional support you provided seems like a reneging on their initial agreement. It's understandable that you felt upset about it, but it's also admirable that you're choosing not to bring it up with your family, given their recent kindness to you.

It's worth noting that this experience might be a good opportunity for you to have a conversation with your family about boundaries and expectations around emotional labor in the future. It's okay to set boundaries and expect compensation for your time and efforts, especially when it's a significant commitment like this.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.9, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 1.0, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.8,0.7,0.2,1.0

I’ve always been a pretty touchy person, nothing sexual, but I love to hug people, hold their hand, poke them, heck I even give my friends messages (again not sexual) for fun. I definitely give people way more attention than they are willing to give me, doesn’t really bother me though. 

I’ve noticed however, that people take me and the attention I give them for granted, as if I’m somewhat disposable. I’m not socially inept in any way, so I can definitely tell people tend to think I’m lesser than them. These people aren’t bad people by any means and I’m sure if you ask them they don’t think of me as any less than themselves, but their actions definitely tell another story. For instance, they tend to think I can’t be serious about things or that I’m incapable of comprehending certain things. (This is definitely not the case, although I’m very private about my merit, I scored in the 1 percentile on the SAT and have maintained a very high GPA throughout college) I get it, I’m an extremely energetic person. 

So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset.

Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?","You're Not The Asshole (NTA) in the sense that you're not intentionally trying to hurt or manipulate others. However, your behavior can be perceived as insensitive or confusing to those around you.

It's great that you enjoy giving people attention and making them feel valued, but it's essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions. By being overly affectionate and available, you may be creating unrealistic expectations about the depth of your relationships.

While you don't expect much in return, others may interpret your behavior as a sign of close friendship or emotional investment. When you eventually move on, it's natural for them to feel upset or angry, as they've developed an emotional attachment to you.

It's not about being ""disposable"" or ""lesser than"" others, but rather about being aware of the impact your actions have on those around you. Your friends may not realize that you're not emotionally invested in the relationship, and that's where the confusion arises.

To avoid hurting others or creating false expectations, consider being more mindful of your behavior and boundaries. You can still be a kind and caring person without leading others on or creating unrealistic expectations. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Be more intentional with your attention**: While it's great that you enjoy giving attention, make sure you're not overdoing it. Be more selective about who you invest your time and energy in.
2. **Communicate your boundaries**: Let your friends know that you value your relationships, but you also need space and time for yourself. This can help prevent misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations.
3. **Be honest about your emotional investment**: If someone asks you about your feelings or the depth of your relationship, be honest and open with them. This can help prevent misinterpretations and hurt feelings.
4. **Respect others' feelings**: When you do decide to move on, be kind and respectful of the other person's feelings. Acknowledge their emotions and show empathy, even if you're not emotionally invested in the relationship.

Remember, being a good friend or acquaintance is not just about giving attention, but also about being respectful, empathetic, and considerate of others' feelings. By being more mindful of your behavior and boundaries, you can build healthier and more meaningful relationships.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.5, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.3,-0.367,-0.5,-0.2

Your boyfriend had already addressed the issue by saying that her comment was ""pretty racist,"" which was a calm and reasonable way to handle the situation. Your addition of ""yeah, that's what a racist WOULD say!"" escalated the situation and put his sister on the defensive.

It's possible that his sister was not aware of the implications of her words and was genuinely trying to share a story about her friend. By calling her out in front of her family, you created an uncomfortable and confrontational atmosphere.

It's also worth considering that his sister might not have been trying to be malicious, but rather ignorant or insensitive. A more constructive approach might have been to have a calm and respectful conversation with her about why her comment was problematic, rather than making a joke that came across as accusatory.

Additionally, it's not your place to ""push her buttons"" or try to provoke a reaction from her. As a guest in their home, it's essential to be respectful and considerate of their feelings, even if you disagree with their views or behaviors.

I had intended on getting a taxi home that night as the hostess had said there’d be people there going in the same direction as me. However, this turned out not to be the case. At 4am I texted my boyfriend not to expect me home that night as I was working the next day, a taxi for that distance on my own was too expensive and found it easier to simply crash at my friend’s. Again, he sent back a thumbs up. ‬

The next morning I arrive in to work and pretty soon after starting receive a text from my bf’s close friend (whom he works with) asking me why I didn’t go home. Confused, I reply that my bf knew I wasn’t coming back. He replied that bf lost his phone and actually had no idea where I was as he hadn’t seen my texts. He then curtly asked that the next time I “couldn’t afford” a taxi home, to call him and he’d pay for it. 

This both pissed me off and weirded me out but I put it to one side and replied that that wouldn’t be necessary and that, as no one had contacted me, I’d had no idea bf had lost his phone or was worried about me. He then jokingly replied that I’d done nothing wrong but to make sure to sleep in ‪the same bed as my bf each night. Again, I found this super intrusive and weird on his part but said nothing as I was more concerned about my bf. ‬

Later, after I arrived home I immediately asked my bf about everything and he seemed confused and said that he had seen all my messages and the only issue was that he was annoyed at me for not letting him know about not coming home sooner which is totally fair. 

I told him about his friend’s messages and he seemed even more confused, saying that he simply asked him to tell me he’d lost his phone, nothing more. This seriously pissed me off and I sent a text to the friend telling him never to send me a text like that again without first being sure of all the facts as it had caused unnecessary worry for me and I felt he’d crossed multiple boundaries. This text was sent a week ago and still no reply. I’m happy to move on and be friends but tbh I want an apology first. I feel like the friend was seriously out of line and had no business saying some of the things he said but my bf’s not too bothered by it and says he sees where the friend was coming from. 

Am I overreacting? Do I deserve an apology or AITA?","You are not overreacting, and you do deserve an apology from his friend. Here's why:

1. Lack of boundaries: His friend's messages were intrusive and crossed multiple boundaries. He had no business asking you to sleep in the same bed as your boyfriend or implying that you're not responsible enough to handle your own life.
2. Unnecessary worry: His friend's messages caused unnecessary worry and stress for you, which is unacceptable. You had already informed your boyfriend about your plans, and he seemed to be okay with it.
3. Misinformation: His friend's initial message about your boyfriend not knowing where you were was a lie. He knew your boyfriend had seen your texts, but he chose to spread misinformation to manipulate the situation.
4. Disrespect: His friend's tone was condescending and judgmental, implying that you're not responsible enough to handle your own life. This kind of attitude is unacceptable in a friend or acquaintance.

You have every right to be upset and to demand an apology from his friend. It's not about being overly sensitive or reactive; it's about setting boundaries and protecting your own emotional well-being.

It's also concerning that your boyfriend seems to be taking his friend's side and downplaying the situation. This could indicate that he's not taking your feelings and boundaries seriously, which is a red flag in any relationship.

You should have a calm and respectful conversation with your boyfriend about why you feel this way and how you'd like him to support you in the future.

Based on your situation, you're in a difficult position, but I'm leaning toward **YTA (You're the Asshole)** here, though with some nuance.

## Why this assessment:

1. **The secretive approach**: Planning a group vacation while deliberately hiding it from someone who considers themselves part of your friend group is hurtful and exclusionary.

2. **Lack of directness**: While you mention having discussed hygiene and behavior issues with them before, continuing a friendship while secretly excluding them from group activities isn't honest.

## Alternative approaches:

- Have an honest conversation specifically about vacation compatibility (not just general behavior)
- Consider planning different types of gatherings where living together isn't required
- Be transparent about why certain trips might not work with them

18,0.433,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA if I suggest selling my engagement ring that I never wear? I have been married to a wonderful man for over a decade. When we first started discussing marriage, I said up front I am not into jewelry and not to spend a lot on an engagement ring. I really only saw myself ever wearing a simple wedding band and a big rock on my finger just wasn't me. But for whatever reason, he still went for a nice ring with a beautiful, quality diamond. It is a beautiful ring, but I only wore it for the 6 months we were engaged, and then when we got married I only wore my wedding band after that. I just find it more practical, it doesn't have a diamond sticking up that can catch on things, and it is a less flashy ring, and just more ""me"" style-wise. I maybe pull my engagement ring out of the safe once a year if we go somewhere nice and get dressed up and even then it is only because my husband suggests I wear it.

Now this ring was given with love but I truly feel more sentimental about my wedding ring than the engagement ring. WIBTA if I suggested to my husband that this engagement ring (probably worth at least 5K) is wasted sitting in a safe 99% of the time and we could sell it and put the money towards something else (mortgage, car loan, family vacation, etc.)? We are not struggling financially, but I we are also pretty practical people who don't spend wastefully either. This ring might have been the biggest exception to that.



1. the value of the ring is not 5k. 5k is what we could probably get for selling it (well the diamond, really). The original price was way more.

2. The ring was bought on credit with a down payment by my husband, and I paid MORE than half of the ring off at the time when we combined finances.

3. The ring is not symbolic to my husband. He didnt want to look like a cheapskate (and wasnt sure I really meant it when I said to buy something cheap) so he spent way more than he should have. He is not upset that I never wear it. He never wears his ring either. He knows the wedding ring is the meaningful one to me. For our anniversary he had our kids birthstones set into it because I wear that one every day.","NTA.  You've been incredibly upfront and honest about your feelings towards jewelry, and your husband knows this.  The fact that he bought a more expensive ring than you both agreed upon doesn't negate your feelings about it now.  Since the ring holds little sentimental value for you, and you've both contributed to its purchase, selling it and using the money for something you both need or want is perfectly reasonable.

The fact that you've paid more than half of the credit off also strengthens your case.  This was a joint purchase in a practical sense, even if the initial decision was his alone.  The sentimental value is clearly with the wedding ring, which you wear daily, and your husband doesn't even wear his ring either.  His lack of upset about you not wearing the engagement ring confirms that the ring's monetary value is far more relevant than its symbolic value to either of you.

Approach the conversation with your husband carefully and lovingly.  Frame it as a practical solution to utilize an asset that isn't serving its purpose.  Focus on the shared benefit of using the money for things you both value, rather than on the act of selling the ring itself.  Your transparency and prior communication about your preferences should make this conversation much easier.

So when my friend kept taking multiple purposely bad photos of me without permission (bad angles, double chins, weird facial expressions) I got annoyed.

1. **Communication**: It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your friend about how their actions made you feel. Explain that while they might think it's a joke, it's hurtful to you.

2. **Boundaries**: Make it clear that you do not want them to take or share photos of you that make you uncomfortable. Friends should respect each other's boundaries.

3. **Self-Respect**: It's important to stand up for yourself and your feelings. Ignoring them might be a temporary solution, but addressing the issue directly could lead to a more lasting resolution.

Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""

She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.

While your comment was a bit snarky, it was a response to years of Abby's condescending and belittling comments about your choice to have children.

However, it's great that you took the opportunity to reflect on your actions and apologize to Abby. By doing so, you showed maturity and a willingness to listen to her perspective. The conversation that followed revealed a more nuanced situation, with Abby's behavior potentially being a response to pressure from your mother-in-law.

It's interesting that you gained more sympathy for Abby after talking to her, and it's a good reminder that people's behaviors are often more complex than they seem.

He's very up to date on the issues and will often interject with factoids about things like law, tax policy, differences in jurisdictions, economics,  etc. Because of this, people tend to respect his opinion.

He's super liberal (as am I) and will often go on impassioned defenses of your standard fare liberal issues and earn ""You're such a great guy!"" comments from our friends and family for progressive views on women's rights and the like. On top of that, his mother considers him an expert on electoral politics and will seek out his opinion during election years.

Here is where I get really annoyed---

My fiance has never registered to vote.  He has never voted. He is well over 30. He has been hiding this from everyone in his family for well over a decade. As far as I know, I'm the only one that knows his secret. 

I've tried to get him to register a million times (we've gone to the movies and walked by easy register stations and he will refuse and say he will do it later). 

He constantly says he will register later, but never does. 

I constantly joke about exposing him, which freaks him out, but I'm actually kind of serious.

 I don't know if I can sit through another political rant about how conservatives are destroying the country without just blurting out *You're not even registered to vote!!!*

I don't have a really good reason for wanting to do this, other than my own irritation...

EDIT--- let me just add, he knows he should register.  We laugh about it together. He also goes on rants about how Trump got elected because so many minorities and uneducated liberals don't vote. So he is not just holding out because he doesn't believe in voting. He is literally out there shaming others for not voting.","In this situation, it seems like you are frustrated with your fiance's hypocrisy, as he advocates for voting and criticizes others for not doing so, but himself has never registered or voted. While it might be tempting to expose him, I would suggest considering the potential consequences before doing so.

Here are a few factors to consider:

1. Motivation: It's important to understand why your fiance hasn't registered to vote. Perhaps there are underlying reasons or barriers that are preventing him from doing so. If that's the case, exposing him might cause more harm than good.

2. Relationship dynamics: Exposing your fiance could potentially damage your relationship. It's crucial to have open and honest communication with your partner, but it's also essential to approach difficult conversations with sensitivity and understanding.

3. The impact on others: If you decide to expose your fiance, it could also affect the way others view him. While some might understand and empathize with his situation, others may judge him harshly, which could lead to unnecessary stress or embarrassment.

4. Productivity: Instead of focusing on exposing your fiance, it might be more productive to encourage him to register to vote. Offer to help him through the process, or find resources that make it easy for him to do so.

In conclusion, while it might be tempting to expose your fiance, it's essential to consider the potential consequences before doing so. Instead, try to have an open and honest conversation with him about voting, and offer your support in helping him register.

My mom has always been a great parent - she's always the one who makes meals for us and does most of the chores at home. I would help around if she would ask, but she rarely does because she's a people pleaser at heart. In that regard, I love her as much as a son should love his mom. She would always put me first, but would treat me like I'm a 14 year old, which I'm getting really tired of. My mom also supports what life decisions I make, and she never really pressures me into pursuing significant careers (especially since I'm of Asian descent).  

&nbsp;

Here's where things get weird - my mom is a very judgmental person. She would often criticize other drivers for being terrible, even when they don't necessarily do anything bad. The worst part about this is that she herself doesn't have a driving license. She also can't take criticism well, *at all*. Whenever my dad jokes around, or says things about the meal being not flavourful enough, she would always get defensive and say ""You cook it then"". Even when my dad jokes about her taking too long to shop or whatever, she would never be able to laugh at herself.

She commented how if she didn't make dinner, this never would have happened. My dad is a very patient man, and he explained how she could just go to her internet history to find the episode, but she wouldn't listen at all.

Based on what you've shared, it seems like you have some valid frustrations with your mom's behavior, but it doesn't necessarily mean you dislike her as a person.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Communication**: It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about how her behavior makes you feel. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings, such as ""I feel frustrated when..."" instead of blaming her with ""You always..."" statements.

2. **Boundaries**: It's important for you to set boundaries for yourself. If her behavior is affecting your well-being, it's okay to distance yourself from it.

3. **Appreciation**: Remember to acknowledge the positive aspects of your relationship. You mentioned that she's a great parent and has always supported you.

4. **Self-reflection**: Consider if there are any underlying issues that might be causing your feelings. It's possible that you're projecting your frustrations onto her.

As for whether you're the asshole, it depends on how you act on these feelings. If you're keeping them to yourself and not letting them affect your behavior towards her, then no, you're not the asshole. However, if you're letting these feelings dictate your actions and you're treating her poorly because of them, then yes, you might be the asshole.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.4,-0.2,-0.4,0.0

Your parents' separation is between them, and while your mom's actions may have precipitated it, you shouldn't be put in the middle or made to feel like you need to choose sides. You're their child, not their confidant or mediator.

When my family came to the first one my dad asked to bring his girlfriend of five months and I said yes, because I love him and I knew it would make him happy.

However, all weekend he was pretty focused on her. They didn’t spend a second apart and I really missed out on getting some time alone with just my actual family. This was a big moment for me and it was sometimes kind of awkward having her around *all the time* considering it was only the fifth time I’ve ever seen her in person. She’s a very nice woman and I have nothing against her, but they haven’t even been dating for six months and I barely know her.

Later this week they’re having the ceremony where my name will be called and I’ll get my diploma, and my dad’s girlfriend has said she’s trying to get time off of work to come to that one too. I really don’t want to be rude, but I would like to have one day where it’s just family. I don’t want to upset my dad, but I didn’t even bring my own boyfriend to the ceremony and he and I have been dating for two years!

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Your Feelings are Valid**: It's okay to want to have an intimate celebration with just your immediate family. This is a significant personal achievement, and you deserve to celebrate it in a way that feels right for you.

2. **Communicate Openly**: If you decide to ask your dad's girlfriend not to attend, approach the conversation with sensitivity. Make it clear that you appreciate her support and enjoyed having her at the first ceremony, but you would like the next one to be just immediate family due to how rare these gatherings are for you.

3. **Acknowledge Your Dad's Role**: You clearly recognize and appreciate your dad's support throughout your education. Maybe you can find a way to celebrate with him and his girlfriend separately, acknowledging his contributions and expressing your gratitude.

4. **Set Boundaries and Compromise**: If this feels too difficult to navigate, you might consider setting boundaries for the day itself—ensuring you have some time alone with your immediate family before or after the ceremony if she attends.

26,0.167,manual,R: NTA AI: YTA,"WIBTA if I give my sister's bearded dragon away? Before I state the situation, I'd like to say that this situation would be a last resort. If things get bad enough, I'd of course speak to my sister before making any decisions, but if she refuses, I would most likely do this without consent if the situation calls for it.

A few months ago, my sister impulsively bought a bearded dragon from a PetCo when she found out her friend had one. She barely read any information on keeping a beardie before thinking she was already an expert.

First, she put a young bearded dragon in a cage with sand bedding. Every source I've read stated that sand bedding for young beardie's is a big no-no because they may ingest it and it could block their digestive system. Thankfully he only spent 2 days with the sand before I scooped it out and replaced it.

&#x200B;

She forgets to buy mealworms for him so he would eat only vegetables for weeks on end until she remembers to go to the pet store to pick them up. From what I read, vegetables should only be around 1/3 of their diet, so I know he shouldn't be eating them exclusively when he eats them on days he has actual mealworms to eat as well. Not to mention she forgets to give him fresh water too. There would be days when I would look into his cage and I'd find that his water bowl is bone dry and I'd discover my sister didn't fill his water for days.

&#x200B;

My sister smokes weed in her room, where she keeps his cage. She also brings in friends who end up smoking in her room as well, both weed and cigarettes. The beardie stays there the entire time.

&#x200B;

Very recently, I went into my sister's room in the morning to take him out of his cage for a little and I found his cage completely open and he wasn't inside. My friend found him under a box 5 minutes later and the poor thing was weak, cold, and bloated. I confronted my sister and informed her that she left the cage door open, thinking this was a mistake. She told me that she did it on purpose and she likes it when he gets out so he could explore. In the past, she also told me she lets him fall from high ledges and she doesn't pay any attention to him when he's out of his cage.

&#x200B;

From my own eyes, this poor thing is stressed out in her care. I know currently things may not call for such drastic measures, but it seems like she's becoming a worse owner every day, like she's getting bored of him. I'm worried for this poor thing and I know he would do better in more competent hands, even now, but that doesn't mean I would do this immediately. If things get bad enough, WIBTA?

&#x200B;

(I'm in no way an expert on bearded dragons. I have done my fair share of research on them so I could try to fill in the gaps of his care that my sister fails to fill and that's about it. If any of these situations aren't things that would be a big deal, please say so. I want to be able to make the right call and I don't want to make any mistakes about this.)","What a concerning situation! It's great that you're taking the initiative to research and ensure the well-being of your sister's bearded dragon. I'll provide you with some insights, and you can decide what's best for the animal.

**The current situation:**

1. **Sand bedding:** You're correct that sand bedding is not recommended for young bearded dragons, as it can cause impaction. Replacing it with a safer substrate, like reptile carpet or paper towels, was a good move.
2. **Diet:** A diet consisting only of vegetables for weeks is not ideal. Bearded dragons require a balanced diet that includes protein sources like insects (mealworms, crickets, etc.). Vegetables should make up about 1/3 of their diet, with insects making up the remaining 2/3.
3. **Hydration:** Forgetting to provide fresh water is a significant concern. Bearded dragons need access to clean water at all times.
4. **Second-hand smoke:** Exposing a bearded dragon to second-hand smoke from weed and cigarettes is not recommended. While there's limited research on the specific effects, it's known that smoke can be detrimental to reptiles' respiratory health.
5. **Cage safety:** Leaving the cage door open, intentionally or not, can be life-threatening for a bearded dragon. They can easily get injured or escape.

**Your concerns and potential actions:**

You've noticed your sister's care is deteriorating, and you're worried about the bearded dragon's well-being. If you feel that the situation is becoming critical, it's essential to consider rehoming the animal to a more competent owner.

**Would you be in the wrong if you gave the bearded dragon away?**

In this situation, it seems that the bearded dragon's welfare is at risk due to your sister's neglect and lack of proper care. If you've tried talking to your sister and she's unwilling to improve her care, it might be necessary to consider rehoming the animal.

**Before taking drastic measures:**

1. **Document everything:** Keep a record of the bearded dragon's living conditions, including photos and notes on its health and behavior.
2. **Talk to your sister (again):** Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns and the bearded dragon's well-being. Emphasize the importance of proper care and the potential consequences of neglect.
3. **Explore alternatives:** If your sister is unwilling or unable to care for the bearded dragon, consider finding a new home with someone who is knowledgeable","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.5, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.5,0.167,0.0,0.5

She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional. Really I just want to call her and tell her the position is filled so not to come in for an interview. But now I’m wondering if that would be shitty of me, maybe she has in fact changed and needs this job to support her family or something. What do you guys think?","What a complicated situation.  While it's understandable that you might not want to work with someone who was a bully in high school, it's also important to consider whether you're being fair to her. 

If you're worried that she might have changed and needs this job, you could consider having the interview and evaluating her based on her qualifications and fit for the role. This way, you're giving her a fair chance, and if she's not a good fit, you can make a decision based on that.

On the other hand, if you're not comfortable working with her, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being. You don't have to reveal the reason for not moving forward with her application, and you can simply tell her that the position has been filled.

It's also worth considering that people can change and grow over time. If she's had a similar experience with someone else, she might have learned from it and become a better person.

Ultimately, the decision is yours. If you're not comfortable working with her, it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and well-being. But if you're willing to give her a chance, having the interview and evaluating her based on her qualifications might be the fairest thing to do.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you do decide not to hire her, it's not necessary to reveal the reason. You can simply say that you've decided to go with another candidate. This way, you're being professional and respectful, even if you're not moving forward with her application.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.267,0.2,0.4
28,0.067,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for wanting to kick my friend out of my flat? Back in May, my best friend broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her. She had nowhere to live and so I said she could move with in me and my partner.
She is the highest earner in our place. She earns around £2000 a month. She LIED about this and told us she was earning a lot less. I found this out because I read her bank statement. We only asked her to pay us £300 a month to live here and that includes rent, taxes, food, gas, internet and electricity. Bearing in mind she also didn’t have to buy any furniture as our spare room was already kitted out. However, within a week of getting paid, her £2000 is like completely gone. I’m not sure how because she doesn’t ever come home with anything that she’s bought and I have no idea where her money is going. It’s starting to affect us because we are having to fork out money that we don’t really have to pay for her travel to work for the rest of the month and also for tobacco that my boyfriend gives her. We never ask her to pay us back and never ask for anything in return. I asked her for £400 a month today, which I feel is very reasonable, but she got annoyed about it.
As well as this, she is very lazy and doesn’t ever tidy up. I do all her washing up and fold her clothes up for her. She leaves talcum powder all over the bathroom floor and smokes in her room despite me telling her multiple times not to. Her room has plates and cups in it that have very old drinks and food on them, which she will then dump downstairs in the sink because she knows I will wash them up. 
I find myself having to avoid her and dread having to spend time with her when my partner isn’t here because she is the type of person to complain about everything. She never bothers to ask how we’re doing and only ever moans about her problems. When we have a problem, her problem has to be 10 times worse and will always take priority. Sometimes she comes into our bedroom screaming about her problems at work and now it’s stressful. Any advice we offer her she ignored and carries on complaining. 
She also seems to have a habit of making subtle digs towards me that stick with me and upset me a little. For example, she called me a bipolar bitch when I was having a down day and belittled the fact I went to the doctor to get medication. 
The cherry on top is when she left her diary in the living room. The page was ripped out and on the table. I was nosey and read it, and it said that she cheated on her boyfriend first. I was so angry because she made all of us feel bad for her, I let her live with me because I felt awful for what he did to her, she cried to us and we did everything we could for her but she cheated on him and I feel as though she has no right to stop us being friends with him and make us take her side because we all thought she was the victim. 
I want to know AMIA for wanting to kick her out because of all this, even though she literally has nowhere else to go?","NTA (Not The Asshole) for wanting to kick your friend out of your flat. While it's understandable that you initially wanted to help your friend in a difficult time, her behavior and actions since moving in have been unacceptable.

Firstly, her dishonesty about her income and her lack of financial responsibility are significant concerns. It's not fair that you and your partner are having to cover expenses for her, especially when she's earning a substantial amount of money.

Additionally, her laziness, lack of tidiness, and disregard for your rules (e.g., smoking in her room) are creating an uncomfortable living environment for you and your partner. It's not reasonable to expect you to do all her washing up and fold her clothes, especially when she's capable of taking care of herself.

Her constant complaining, lack of empathy, and subtle digs towards you are also taking a toll on your mental health and well-being. It's not healthy to have someone in your living space who consistently drains your energy and makes you feel bad about yourself.

The revelation about her cheating on her ex-boyfriend and manipulating your sympathy is a significant betrayal of trust. It's understandable that you feel angry and hurt by this discovery.

While it's true that your friend has nowhere else to go, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your partner. You've been more than generous and accommodating, and it's time to set boundaries and consider your own needs.

Before making any decisions, you may want to consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend about your concerns and expectations. However, if her behavior doesn't change, it may be necessary to reevaluate the living arrangement and explore options for her to find alternative accommodation.

Remember, you have the right to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs in your own home. Don't feel guilty about wanting to protect your own well-being and living environment.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.1}",0.1,0.067,0.0,0.1

Now this isn't like Florida not the best neighborhood but small city not the best. So no gun violence, and no stabbing. Just maybe random b and e. 
But even those happen rarely I would think. 
We do have a lot of homeless and a lot of drug addiction in the area. And outside of downtown our neighborhood has the highest police calls.
Because of this when ever our one dog barks at people in the front yard we don't discourage it. 
Now where I might be an asshole is my dog is truly a beast when she barks. She's a pittbul/Rottweiler mix and her hackles rise and she scares the shit out of people.
She's completely fenced in, there's no way she's getting out. She actually listens really well so when I call her she immediately stops and comes running back. And I always call her back when I see who she's barking at.
I've had random dudes all in black with their hoods up get the piss scared out of them and then start yelling and calling me an asshole.
I've also had her bark and scare the shit out of a Muslim mom and her kids. 
But she's also scared off this one guy that used to come to up to our house and look around... ask questions about our renos. He'd come around a couple times a month before we got the dogs. 

Additional info we've only had the dogs for three months. They are 7 and 10 a bonded pair. The younger one is the barker. I never leave the barker in the front yard alone. I always watch her and she doesn't really like to leave my side either way. I do try to dissuade her from barking at mom's and kids but it's hard for her to know the difference. 


EDIT: the dog is only allowed outside to go for a pee. I AM NOT LEAVING HER OUTSIDE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF BARKING AT PEOPLE TO KEEP THEM AWAY. 



Tldr: aita for letting my dog bark and scare people?","The age-old debate about whether to let your dog defend your property or not!

While I understand your concerns about the neighborhood and the potential threats, I have to say that your approach might not be the most effective or responsible one. Here's why:

1. **Fear and intimidation are not effective deterrents**: While your dog's barking and aggressive behavior might scare off some people, it's unlikely to deter serious criminals or individuals who mean harm. In fact, it could even escalate the situation, making things worse.
2. **You're creating a hostile environment**: By allowing your dog to bark and scare people, you're creating a hostile environment for your neighbors, visitors, and even your own family members. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, fear, and even legal issues.
3. **It's not a long-term solution**: As you mentioned, you've only had the dogs for three months, and it's unlikely that they'll remain effective at scaring people off forever. Additionally, there are many other ways to secure your property and protect yourself without relying on your dog's barking.
4. **You're not teaching your dog responsible behavior**: By encouraging your dog to bark at people, you're not teaching her responsible behavior or socialization skills. This can lead to behavioral problems and difficulties in the future.
5. **There are other ways to protect your property**: Consider investing in security cameras, motion-sensitive lights, and other deterrents that won't put people or animals at risk. You can also work with your neighbors to create a safer, more cohesive community.

That being said, I'm not saying that you're entirely in the wrong. It's understandable that you're concerned about your safety and the safety of your property. However, I do think that there are more effective and responsible ways to address these concerns.

Perhaps consider the following:

* Work with your partner to develop a comprehensive security plan that includes multiple layers of protection.
* Invest in training and socialization for your dogs to help them become well-behaved and well-adjusted.
* Focus on building positive relationships with your neighbors and the community to create a safer, more supportive environment.
* Consider seeking advice from a professional dog trainer or security expert to help you develop a more effective and responsible approach.

Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I hope this helps you weigh the pros and cons and consider alternative solutions.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.6, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.3,-0.433,-0.6,-0.3

2. **Impact on Relationship:** Think about whether her views on vaccines will come up often and whether they will impact your ability to enjoy your time together. Can you agree to disagree and respect each other's perspectives, or will it create tension?

3. **Common Ground:** Focus on the aspects of your friendship that you enjoy and have in common. If you find that you can genuinely enjoy her company without her beliefs being a constant point of contention, the friendship might still be worth pursuing.

4. **Boundaries:** Consider establishing boundaries around topics that are off-limits in your discussions. This could help maintain the friendship without diving into areas that might cause friction.

5. **Long-term Potential:** Consider the long-term potential of the friendship. Are her views something that might change over time, or are they deeply rooted in her identity? Would this friendship add value to your life?

So Reddit, AITA?","YTA.  While your intentions are good, your approach is incredibly damaging.  You're essentially dismissing his dreams and aspirations at a crucial age.  Instead of offering supportive guidance, you're being dismissive and crushing his enthusiasm.

Focusing on the vast number of unsuccessful YouTubers is a negative and unhelpful tactic.  While it's true that success on YouTube is difficult, it doesn't mean it's impossible.  Many successful YouTubers started small and worked hard.  Your brother's ambition, even if ultimately unrealized, could teach him valuable skills like creativity, video editing, marketing, and communication.

Instead of telling him his dreams are unrealistic, try offering constructive criticism and support.  Perhaps you could help him brainstorm ways to improve his content or suggest resources to learn video editing.  You could also help him explore other avenues for income while pursuing his YouTube channel.  It's not an ""either/or"" situation.

Focusing on ""trade or college"" as the only viable options is also limiting. There are many successful career paths that don't involve a traditional college degree.

**Backstory:**  My daughter is now 7 years old. After kiddo was born and I went back to work, my mom watched her in the hours that overlapped my SO's and I's jobs. We eventually bought a house around the corner from my parents. My mom's continued to watch kiddo for 3 years. Until my mom got very ill and required surgery. During this time, mom said she was unable to watch her any longer. Sister took over watching kiddo in the overlap. Going into this arrangement, both mom and sister said they didn't need to be paid for this. **However**, I did give them money from my tax return every year and also any extra that I happened to be able to share. I also offered MANY times to put kiddo into daycare, there's a ""by income"" program in our state that would have made daycare affordable. After my sister took over, my mom would take kiddo out once a week for a few hours. Of course, kiddo grew VERY attached to her grandmother and aunt.

**Present**: Shortly after my daughter turned 3,I became fully disabled and unable to work. Over these past few years mom/sis basically ghosted kiddo. The only time they see/talk to kiddo is if I bring her around to them. My dad comes around and sees kiddo on his way home from work whenever he can. The only time mom/sis for sure see kiddo is holidays, which my mom is quick to post any and all pics of kiddo on FaceySpace to show off. 

**Here's what gets me** I've been present more than a few times when a family member or friend comments to my mother/sis how nice it is to have my kiddo right around the corner and they can see her whenever they want and how much time they must get to spend together...etc. When these conversations occur, mom/sis neglect to mention the fact that they go MONTHS without seeing or even talking to kiddo. They're more than happy to agree with whatever the person is saying though.


I'm fed up with it. Don't use my kid to make yourself look better. My kid has cried to me asking why her grandmother/aunt don't like her, why don't they come and see her, why they don't take her anywhere anymore, etc. I try and be as diplomatic as possible, explaining they both have health issues/are busy. Yes, they both have health issues, but neither one's issues are so bad that it would prevent them from seeing kiddo for months at a time. I have attempted to talk to mom/sis MULTIPLE times about spending time with kiddo, but my words fall on deaf ears.


**Would I be the asshole** if the next time someone comments to mom/sis how great it is that we live so close to them, I tell that person that mom/sister don't actually see/talk to kiddo for months at a time?


I have considered the fact that maybe kiddo is unpleasant to spend time with, but I really don't see that as being the case.I get compliments on her from people all the time about what a sweet kid she is and how well behaved she is, she really IS awesome! So I don't think that's it.

I await your judgement!","You're considering calling out your mom and sister for their lack of involvement in your daughter's life, and I'm here to help you decide if that would be a reasonable response.

Firstly, it's understandable that you're frustrated and hurt by their behavior. Your daughter is clearly affected by their absence, and it's not fair to use her as a prop to make themselves look good to others. You've tried talking to them about this issue multiple times, and they've ignored your concerns.

In this situation, I wouldn't say you're the asshole for speaking up. In fact, it's reasonable to correct the narrative and provide a more accurate representation of their involvement in your daughter's life. By doing so, you're not only standing up for your daughter's feelings but also holding your mom and sister accountable for their actions.

However, it's essential to consider the timing and approach. You might want to choose a private moment to discuss this with your mom and sister, rather than calling them out in front of others. This could help prevent unnecessary conflict and allow for a more constructive conversation.

When you do decide to speak up, try to focus on the specific behavior that's causing the issue (i.e., their lack of involvement and using your daughter as a prop) rather than making a personal attack. You could say something like:

""Hey, I've noticed that when people comment on how great it is that we live close to you, you don't always mention that you don't actually get to spend much time with [daughter's name]. I understand that you both have health issues and are busy, but it's been really tough for [daughter's name] to feel like she's not a priority to you. I wish we could find a way to make more time for her, even if it's just a regular phone call or visit.""

By framing the conversation in this way, you're addressing the specific issue and expressing your concerns in a non-accusatory manner.

Remember, your daughter's feelings and well-being are what's most important here. If speaking up helps to create a more honest and open dialogue about your mom and sister's involvement in her life, then it's likely a reasonable response.

So, to answer your question: No, you wouldn't be the asshole for speaking up and correcting the narrative. In fact, it's a necessary step to advocate for your daughter's emotional well-being.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.6,0.333,0.0,0.6

So I work at a company that drives to different clients to service equipment. I work with Mike (fake name). Mike is a new hire who comes with me to everything I do. All of the techs in our company are under our manager John (fake name). Thus I don't really have any ""authority"" to tell Mike what to do, but he'll still listen to me.

A store's fan was not working. After we isolated the problem to the fan itself, I told Mike to get the step ladder. In case you don't know, when you are on a step ladder, you're not supposed to stand on the top two steps. You're also not supposed to overreach. People break both of those rules regularly, almost always without injury. I was at the highest safe step and I could barely reach the fan. I would have had to break one of those rules to access it.

I called John.

> John: ""The one in your truck should be fine.""

> Me: ""It's not.""

> Me: ""I went as far up as I am supposed to go. I can't reach it safely from there.""

> John: ""For fuck's sake, u/AdorablePreference. Let me speak to Mike.""

He apparently told Mike to ""just fucking do it."" Mike wanted to do it. I just said ""no you're not"" and I took the ladder down. Long story short, John drove over to fix it himself (in the unsafe way) as Mike and I watched.

Am I the asshole?

tldr I defied my boss because of a possibly unnecessary safety rule. I also brought another employee into the conflict.","It's understandable that you prioritized safety, but let's break down the situation to determine if you were in the wrong.

1. **Safety Concerns**: You had valid safety concerns about using the step ladder to reach the fan. Safety should always be a priority, and it's commendable that you were cautious.

2. **Defying Your Boss**: You defied your boss's direct instruction, which can be seen as insubordination. Even if you believe the instruction is unsafe, there are typically protocols in place for handling such situations, such as escalating the issue to higher management or HR.

3. **Involving the New Hire**: You involved Mike in the conflict, which could potentially put him in a difficult position. As a more experienced employee, you should have handled the situation more diplomatically, especially since Mike is new and might feel obligated to follow your lead.

4. **Escalation**: Instead of immediately defying John, you could have suggested alternative solutions, such as using a different type of ladder or equipment that could reach the fan safely. If John still insisted, you could have asked him to document the decision, ensuring that both of you are protected if anything goes wrong.

Given these points, it seems you were trying to do the right thing by prioritizing safety, but your approach could have been handled better. You might not be the asshole for having safety concerns, but you could have managed the situation more professionally.

In the future, consider the following steps:

1. Clearly communicate your safety concerns to your boss.
2. Suggest alternative solutions.

37,0.267,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for wanting a financial abortion? So I dated a girl for a few months, it was shaping up to be a longterm thing, but things went bad. We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. 

This was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.

I have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.

Her friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a ""financial abortion"", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???","I'll provide you with a neutral and informative response.

**Emotional Response:**
It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and shocked by the news, especially given your clear stance on not wanting children. Your reaction is a natural response to a life-altering situation.

**Legal Perspective:**
In most jurisdictions, a biological father cannot simply ""opt-out"" of parental responsibilities, including child support. If the mother chooses to keep the child, you may still be legally obligated to provide financial support, regardless of whether you want to be involved in the child's life.

The concept of a ""financial abortion"" is not a formal legal term, but it's often referred to as ""disestablishing paternity"" or ""terminating parental rights."" However, this is typically only possible in specific circumstances, such as:

1. **Adoption:** If the mother puts the child up for adoption, you may be able to relinquish your parental rights.
2. **Court-ordered termination:** In some cases, a court may terminate your parental rights if it's deemed to be in the best interest of the child.
3. **Voluntary relinquishment:** Some jurisdictions allow a biological father to voluntarily relinquish their parental rights, but this is often subject to certain conditions and may require the mother's consent.

**Moral Perspective:**
The moral implications of your decision are complex and depend on individual values and beliefs. Some people may view your desire to avoid parental responsibilities as selfish, while others may understand your perspective and the importance of being honest about your desires and capabilities as a parent.

**Next Steps:**
Consider seeking professional advice from a family law attorney to understand your legal obligations and options. They can help you navigate the situation and provide guidance on how to proceed.

Additionally, you may want to consider having an open and honest conversation with the mother about your feelings, concerns, and boundaries. While you've made it clear that you don't want to be involved in the child's life, it's essential to approach the conversation with empathy and respect.

**Am I the Asshole? (AITA) Verdict:**
Not necessarily. Your reaction is understandable, given the circumstances. However, it's essential to acknowledge that your decision may have significant emotional and financial implications for the mother and the child. While you have the right to make choices about your own life, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of your actions on others.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue a ""financial abortion"" or terminate parental rights is a personal one, and it","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.8, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.8,0.267,0.0,0.8
38,0.233,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"WIBTA If I told my (16 F) Stepsister (17 F) that she needs to stop relying on me to wake her up for school in the morning? First ever Reddit post, hopefully this is right. 

For background info, my stepsister and I have been related ever since I was ~2 years old. Her and I don’t have a great relationship whatsoever, and she purposely does things to hurt me and piss me off.

My stepsister and I have been going to school together since middle school after I moved in with my dad and stepmom. Ever since we entered high school, she had started this thing where she refuses to get out of bed in the mornings, despite me waking her up constantly. It’s not something I want to do, but it’s only to help out my parents  (who will be late to work if they have to drive us to school). She gets mad at me, yells at me, throws a fit, all that stuff. Normally, I would understand why she’d be cranky, as when I’m being forced to wake up at 6 a.m. I’m pretty cranky too. Although, there’s this huge difference between the two of us. She likes to stay up all night blasting the television or talking on the phone while I prefer to go to bed at a decent time. Another thing is, she likes to constantly cause a ruckus and keep the rest of me and our family up while we are trying to sleep. I try to get over it, but I’m downright tired of being forced to fall asleep much later than I need to, and then having to deal with her berating me when I wake her up much later than I actually get up. Not only that, but our bus arrives around 6:30, it normally takes ~10 minutes for any normal person to get dressed and have time to gather their belongings and grab a bite to eat. Instead, she locks herself in the bathroom the entire time and refuses to let me take the two minutes I need to brush my hair, brush my teeth, and take a quick pee when I need to. Just this morning she locked herself in the bathroom the entire time and refused to let me in, and subsequently she was angry with *me* when she missed the bus because I “woke her up too late.” I didn’t even get a chance to wash up this morning and had to go to school looking like I just stumbled out of the morgue because I woke her up and she decided that she didn’t want to get ready because I “woke her up too early.”

I’m extremely tired of having her berate me for not waking her up earlier (which would mean I have to wake up earlier) but then having her complain at the same time that I wake her up too early. She has tons of alarm clocks, she just refuses to use them. I’m thinking of just telling her to wake herself up if she keeps treating me like shit because of it.

TL;DR: My stepsister gets mad at me for waking her up for school in the morning. WIBTA if I tell her to start waking herself up if she’s going to treat me like shit when I’m only trying to make sure she gets to school?","You would not be the asshole (NTA) if you told your stepsister to start waking herself up. It seems unreasonable for her to rely on you to wake her up, especially when she treats you poorly for doing so. You're going above and beyond to help out, and it's impacting your own mornings and sleep. Here are a few suggestions on how you might approach the situation:

1. **Talk to Your Parents:** Explain the situation to your parents calmly and let them know how it's affecting you. They might not be fully aware of what's going on and could have suggestions or rules to help address the issue.

2. **Set Boundaries:** It's important for her to learn to take responsibility for her own schedule, especially since she's nearly an adult. Make it clear that you won't be waking her up moving forward and why you've made that decision.

3. **Offer a Solution:** You could suggest that she set alarms or have a nighttime routine to help her get up on her own. Maybe propose a shared schedule or bathroom routine in the morning to minimize disruption for you both.

4. **Follow Through:** It may take some adjustment, but stick to your decision. It’s her responsibility to manage her mornings, and it's unfair for that to be entirely on you, especially when it's impacting your well-being.

It sounds like you've been very patient, but clear boundaries and communication with your stepsister and parents might help improve the situation for everyone involved.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.30000000000000004,0.233,0.1,0.4
39,-0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for handing in my group project, after having edited my partners’s contributions without them knowing? I am currently trying to get a new degree while going to school part time. I want to get through and as fast as I can (to save money) and to learn as much as I can.

We have to do a project that consists of 2 parts. A formative one we have to do in groups, and a summative one which is individual. The formative one is to prepare you for the summative one, and as we hand it in we will receive feedback that we can use to do the summative one. 

Naturally, I want to do the best i can on the formative one, so I can get the most constructive feedback to create the best possible summative assignment I can. I was not allowed to choose my teammates.  I got paired with to women who are both not the strongest of the bunch in terms of grades and knowledge, but that is fine, we are there to learn.

We started off working very well together, dividing the tasks and giving each other feedback. Teammate 1 drops a bomb that she’ll be dropping out after december. In her words: ‘’I will try to finish my part, but I can’t give my all anymore, knowing there’s no reward in it for me.’’ Red flags to me, I want good feedback. I tell her so, and offer to take over her part, but she is adamant. Fine.

Teammate 2 just doesn’t understand how to write an essay. She picked a very sketchy source to base her piece on, and then didn’t reference to it in her text, whilst making numerous grammatic errors and leaving out vital structural pieces. I told her this twice. She adjusted it, twice, but it just became different; not better. We calles the teacher over, he explained again to her how it was wrong, and she adjusted it again, wrongly, again. He tried again, pointing out flaws to both teammate 1 and 2, but they didn’t adjust it correctly. I stopped explaining after this.

I took on the task of editing the entire thing together and I saw the monstrosity of an essay. And I completely rewrote the thing. I stayed true to the core of what teammate 2 wanted to say, but used a reliable source, edited wording, grammar, structure and added some stuff. I rewrote teammate 1’s entire piece. New topic even. I feel bad about doing it, but I want to get feedback I can work with instead of ‘’it’s all weird and wrong’’. I can’t work with the feedback on only my part, as teammate 1 and 2 also wanted to take on the introduction and conclusion. 

I feel like it’s a selfish move, but they weren’t getting my or my teacher’s feedback at all, and kept making a mess out of it. I might have robbed them of their opportunity to learn, but feel like they were robbing me of mine. I’m a bit torn. Am I the asshole?","It's understandable that you want to get the most out of your educational experience and that you're frustrated with the situation. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Academic Integrity**: By rewriting your teammates' contributions without their knowledge or consent, you've essentially taken credit for their work, which is a violation of academic integrity. Even if their work was poor, it was still their effort, and they should have been given the opportunity to learn from their mistakes.

2. **Teamwork**: Group projects are designed to teach teamwork and collaboration. By taking over their parts, you've denied them the chance to learn and grow from the experience.

3. **Communication**: You mentioned that you told your teammates twice about the issues with their work, but you didn't communicate your plan to rewrite their parts. This could have led to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.

4. **Feedback**: Even if the feedback on their parts would have been negative, it would have been a learning opportunity for them.

Given these points, it seems like you might be the asshole in this situation. However, it's important to note that your actions were likely driven by a desire to succeed and learn, which is understandable.

In the future, it might be helpful to:

1. Communicate more openly with your teammates about your concerns and plans.
2. Seek help from your teacher or a tutor to improve your teammates' understanding of the material.
3. Focus on your own part of the project and let your teammates handle their own parts, even if they're not doing as well as you'd like.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.6, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.6,-0.333,-0.6,0.0

TL:DR - got kicked out of my section at a hockey game yesterday by a power hungry usher for being “too loud and annoying”, security laughed at him and his manager chewed him out, tried to generate discussion in original thread but feeling some anger directed at me instead

I was directed to this sub by a commenter in the original post.  I guess I can’t provide full context unless you’ve been at a live sporting event AND have a devout passion for one of the teams playing, but this is Reddit, so everyone is allowed to have an opinion. 😂  And this rabbit hole is fun for me, I want to see how far this goes!

My questions:
1) I went to school in Philadelphia, so East Coast sports fans are “more passionate” or “assholes” depending on your view.  Does this play into how you should act at a sporting event?  I’ve never gotten yelled at before, why now?

2) I am naturally a loud person, despite having to act professional and be quieter in most environments, including work.  It is rare that I get to cheer overly loud for my team.  Should I just stay home from now on?

3) My wife tells me to tone it down all the time, but has never done so at a live game.  And I’m lucky she’s still with me, haha.  Is there a range of tolerance levels/“fandom” that I’m not aware of?

4) I had a mix of fans from both teams around me, including some friends.  As I stayed silent the 2nd period, I was making jokes and most of them chuckled.  Needed to add this info to provide some more context.

So have at it Reddit!!  Am I the asshole here?!? (humor and sarcasm fully endorsed!)

Edit: added point #4","Based on your description, let's break down the potential situations:

1. **Passion vs. Disruption:** Being passionate about your team is great, but it can cross a line if it disrupts others' enjoyment. Different regions have different norms, but ultimately, it boils down to respecting the people around you. You might have encountered a scenario where people weren't accustomed to such behavior, and the usher perhaps reacted to complaints about your conduct.

2. **Cheering vs. Being Overly Loud:** Cheering for your team is expected at a sporting event, but if your volume becomes overwhelming or disruptive, especially if sustained, it might irritate those around you. If your routines are disturbing other spectators, considering toning it down or finding a way to channel that energy more acceptably could help.

3. **Consider Your Surroundings:** Your wife's advice is worth considering. If she's mentioned your volume but hasn't addressed it in a game setting, she might be indicating that it’s more acceptable in that context, within reason. There's a balance of being a devoted fan while also being mindful of others' experiences.

4. **Feedback from Friends and Nearby Fans:** If the people around you, including opposing team fans, were mostly laughing and engaging with you positively, it suggests a level of acceptance. However, not everyone might have been as pleased or comfortable expressing their discomfort directly. 

Ultimately, whether or not you're an ""asshole"" here depends on how disruptive your behavior was relative to the norms of the crowd and the perceptions of those around you. Reflecting on interactions like the usher's response and your wife's advice might provide some insight. It could be beneficial to strive for enthusiasm that enhances your experience and those around you rather than detracting from it.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

42,0.3,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for tellinng my parents that they ruined kids for me? During a family gathering my parents once again started asking me about when I'll give them grandbabies. I have been married for 3 years and neither me nor my husband have interest in having kids of our own. I usually just brush them off and walk away but this time they were being extremely persistent. Especially because my brothers and sisters were around and some of them already have families of their own, even though they're younger than me.

The reason why I'm not into the idea of having kids is that I had to play the role of a parent to all my siblings (6 of them). My parents were irresponsible and had me at 16. Once I was 5 they had my first sibling and the rest of them were born soon after. So since I was very young I had to help out my mother and supervise/take care of 6 kids while being a kid myself.

I never mentioned this to my parents because they never asked me my motives, in fact they brush off the excuses I give them. So I decided that maybe if I were honest they would finally understand but I was very wrong in that assumption.  My mother was crying halfway through the explanation and my father got very heated. I tried to have it be a private conversation away from where everyone else was but since things went downhill all my siblings got very curious about what had happened.

I had to then explain what had happened to my siblings which ended up turning into a bigger mess. I was called ungrateful, hurtful, asshole and cold hearted for not only blaming my parents but also for making my siblings feel like they were burdens. At this point my husband and I decided to leave, which only escalated things even further because I ended up getting kicked out of the family group chat and also have been blocked by most of them on social media.

Edit: I want to say thank you to everyone giving advice and being so kind. Also, to everyone that went through the same situation as me, I can't reply to you all but I'm reading everything.","**NTA (Not The Asshole)**

It's understandable that you felt the need to express your feelings and explain why you don't want to have kids. Given your childhood experiences, it's clear that you had to take on a lot of responsibility at a young age, and it's reasonable that this has shaped your views on parenthood.

Your parents' persistent questioning and lack of understanding about your feelings and motivations likely contributed to your frustration. While it's possible that they didn't mean to be hurtful, their reactions to your honesty were defensive and dismissive.

It's not about blaming your parents or making your siblings feel like burdens; it's about sharing your perspective and experiences. You had to take care of your siblings and essentially parent them, which can be a heavy emotional burden. It's not something that can be easily brushed off or ignored.

Your parents' reactions, including your mother's tears and your father's anger, suggest that they may not be willing to acknowledge or understand the impact of their actions on you. It's possible that they're not ready to have this conversation or confront their own responsibilities as parents.

It's unfortunate that the conversation escalated and led to you being ostracized by your family. However, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries. You don't have to justify your choices or feelings to anyone, and it's okay to set limits with your family.

**Takeaways:**

1. You have the right to express your feelings and opinions.
2. Your experiences and perspectives are valid.
3. It's okay to set boundaries with your family, especially if they are not respectful or understanding.
4. You don't have to justify your choices or feelings to anyone.

It's great that you have a supportive husband and that you're reading and appreciating the advice and kind words from others who have gone through similar situations.

Before I dive into the answer, let's clarify some things. What kind of ""friend"" are we talking about? Is it a close, long-term friend or someone you've only recently met? Have you been invited to other important events in their life, like birthdays or holidays? Are there any underlying issues or conflicts that might be contributing to your hesitation?

Assuming you're asking about a situation where you're genuinely unsure about attending the wedding, here are some factors to consider:

1. **The quality of the friendship**: If you're close friends, it's likely that you'll want to support them on their special day. If you're not as close, you might feel less inclined to attend.
2. **Your relationship with the couple**: Are you friends with the bride and groom individually, or just with one of them? If it's the latter, you might feel more obligated to attend for their sake.
3. **The circumstances of the invitation**: Was the invitation extended at the last minute, or did you have plenty of notice? Are there any other factors that might be making it difficult for you to attend (e.g., financial constraints, conflicting commitments)?
4. **Your personal boundaries**: Are there any specific reasons why you don't feel comfortable attending the wedding (e.g., the couple's values or beliefs don't align with yours, you're not comfortable with the guest list, etc.)?

Now, would I be ticked off if you didn't go to your ""friend's"" wedding? It depends on the context and your reasons for not attending. If you're genuinely unable to attend due to circumstances beyond your control, I wouldn't be upset. However, if you're using the wedding as an excuse to avoid the event or your ""friend"" altogether, that might be a different story.

Ultimately, the decision to attend or not attend a wedding is a personal one. If you're unsure about what to do, consider having an open and honest conversation with your ""friend"" about your concerns or limitations.

For some background info I (36F) made friends with a woman (31F) at my bingo group a few years ago. We became pretty close and would hang out at least once a week. During this time my life was getting turned upside down fairly regularly due to career changes, family issues, and a major health problem. 

Over time I noticed that whatever I or anyone else was going through in my life, somehow she was ""dealing with the same thing"" only worse. Her family is pretty well off, but she insisted that she was not supported by them and had to scrimp to even clothe her kids. That despite living with her father, he never helped with anything. She would tell people all sorts of stories about her family. Of the ones I remember;

1. That her father was extremely abusive to her mother, and had killed her in cold blood (but got away with it because he was rich.)

2. That her father made her pretend to be a boy until she was 17 because he didn't want a daughter.

3. That the females in her family were branded at birth and she was an outcast and denied all rights because she refused to allow them to brand her daughter.

4. That her brother was a meth addict and that his children were being taken away by the state and given to her. 

5. That she had a genetic disease that has made every member of her family go blind in their left eye. But don't ask them about it.

6. That her, her husband and children were going to be put in witness protection for testifying against her father. 

7. That the gym we were going to was calling her father and her brother to report everything we did.

8. That she had leukemia and was dying.

9. That she was a gold medal winning gymnast who had been forced to give up the Olympics  due to a heart condition.

If I won at bingo I would end up either giving my winnings to her due to some ""urgent need"" (ie. her cat was sick and the vet put it on a special diet that they couldn't afford, Her daughter needed a dress for a holiday concert at preschool).

Just before Christmas her car broke down and her father had given them a car for an early Christmas gift, but was refusing to help pay for it to get registered as he expected them to cover that cost on their own.  They were on a very fixed budget and couldn't afford the extra expense. 

 I saved all of my tips over the holiday to help with the registration costs. I saved up over $500 and presented her with it the next time I saw her. 

When I walked her to the car I saw that she already had the new licence plate and registration.  The next day she tells me that her father paid for new bowling shoes, balls, and paid all the fees for a league by giving her the exact amount I had given her, in cash. 

I stopped talking to her at that point.

 I figure she wrangled a couple thousand dollars out of me and I want them to know what she is doing.","It's understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed by your friend, given the stories she told and the money you gave her. It's important to consider the potential consequences of telling her father about the lies she's been spreading.

Before taking action, consider the following points:

1. **Intentions and Consequences:** Reflect on your motivations for wanting to tell her father. Are you seeking justice, wanting to protect him, or simply wanting to expose her? Consider how your actions might affect her family dynamics and whether it would actually bring about a positive change.

2. **Credibility and Impact:** Given the nature of the stories she told, it's possible her father may already be aware of her tendency to exaggerate or fabricate. If you do decide to talk to him, be prepared for him to potentially dismiss your claims or question your intentions.

3. **Personal Boundaries:** You mentioned that you stopped talking to her after realizing the pattern of dishonesty. It's okay to prioritize your well-being and distance yourself from toxic relationships. Sometimes walking away without further involvement is the best choice for your peace of mind.

4. **Legal and Safety Considerations:** Be aware that involving yourself in someone else's family matters can have legal and safety implications, especially if her stories involve serious accusations. Ensure that you're not putting yourself at risk.

If you ultimately decide to speak with her father, approach the conversation with caution and empathy, focusing on your experiences and feelings rather than making accusatory statements. You might also consider seeking advice from a neutral third party or counselor before taking any action.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.3,-0.167,-0.3,0.0

My parents don’t do this. They go to the same Chinese restaurant and when I ask them how it was my dad will say, “the chicken was really good” - with no other observation or note ... and it’s the same chicken dish he would get every time. Or he will comment that he would not like to go to that Chinese restaurant until 8pm, because that’s when the crowd dies - and he’ll say this nearly every time without fail if they want to go to that restaurant.

It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your feelings and try to understand why you're feeling this way. Recognizing that your parents are sensors and you're an intuitive can help you understand why you might be feeling misunderstood and frustrated.

You might be craving more meaningful conversations, new experiences, and a sense of excitement and discovery. Your parents, as sensors, might be more focused on routine, stability, and practicality, which can make it challenging for you to connect with them on a deeper level.

It's not necessarily about your parents being ""bad"" or ""boring""; it's just that their personalities and preferences might not align with yours. You can still love and appreciate them while acknowledging that you have different needs and expectations.

Here are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:

1. Communicate your needs: Try to have open and honest conversations with your parents about what you need from them. Be specific about what you're looking for in terms of conversations, activities, or interactions.
2. Find common ground: While your parents might not be passionate about the same things as you, there might be areas where you can find common ground. Try to find activities or topics that interest both you and your parents, even if they're not your favorite things.
3. Set boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed or drained from interacting with your parents, it's okay to take a step back and recharge.
4. Seek support: Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member about your feelings and experiences. They can help you process your emotions and develop strategies for coping with the challenges of having parents who are sensors.
5. Practice self-compassion: Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have complex relationships with their parents, and it's okay to acknowledge that you're not getting what you need from them. Be kind to yourself and try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship.

Remember, you're not entitled to have a certain type of relationship or experience; you're entitled to have your needs met and to feel fulfilled in your interactions with others.","{""swaggamasta420"": 1.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.8,0.533,0.2,1.0
46,0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA For arguing that I should be dropped off at school like normal instead of walking? I am a high school student, and my dad drops me off at school every day, along with my brother. His classes start at 7:30, so we leave at 7:10 to make sure that he gets to school in time, as we have to drop me off first (I would be late if he were dropped off first). If I don't get into the car at 7:10, I will get dropped off in a shopping center close to my school instead of the road next to it, so my brother will still be on time. We have another rule where if someone else is late instead of me (usually it's my fault we are late) I will get dropped off near the school like normal.

&#x200B;

Today, my brother and I got into the car at the same time (7:11), but my dad still said I had to walk. I made the argument that since my brother and I got into the car at the same time we were technically both late, but my dad wouldn't hear any of it. He said that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and my brother was already ready at the time, he just was waiting on my dad and I (my dad started the car around 7:10, and my brother quickly followed; he was getting into the car as I was walking towards it and we shut the doors maybe 5 seconds apart).

&#x200B;

It ended up getting into a big argument with my dad, and later my mom, who admitted that the rules were ambiguous but said I needed to take responsibility for my actions (which I feel I did, but according to her ""I was late, but we closed the door at the same time so we were both late"" is not being responsible). AITA? Thanks.","To determine whether you are in the wrong (AITA), let's break down the situation:

1. **Established Rules**:
   - You and your brother are dropped off at school in a specific order.
   - If you are not in the car by 7:10, you get dropped off at a shopping center.
   - If someone else is late, you get dropped off normally.

2. **Today's Incident**:
   - Both you and your brother got into the car at 7:11.
   - Your dad still dropped you off at the shopping center.

3. **Your Argument**:
   - Since both of you got into the car at the same time, you both were technically late, so you should be dropped off normally.

4. **Your Parents' Perspective**:
   - Your dad and mom believe you should take responsibility for your actions and that the rules are clear.

Given these points, here are a few considerations:

- **Clarity of Rules**: The rules do seem a bit ambiguous. If both of you are late, it's not clear whether the rule applies to the first person to get into the car or both.

- **Responsibility**: Your parents' perspective is that you should take responsibility for your actions. However, if the rules are not clear, it's reasonable to argue that both of you being late should result in a different outcome.

- **Consistency**: If the rule is that the first person to get into the car determines the drop-off, then your dad's decision makes sense. If the rule is that both of you being late means a different outcome, then your argument holds.

Given the ambiguity and the fact that both of you were late, it seems like there might be room for a more flexible interpretation of the rules. However, your parents' insistence on strict adherence to the rules, as they understand them, is also valid.

**Verdict**: It's a bit of a gray area, but you do have a point about the ambiguity of the rules. It might be worth having a family discussion to clarify the rules and ensure everyone is on the same page.

So, **NAH** (Not the Asshole). The situation is more about a misunderstanding of the rules rather than anyone being clearly in the wrong.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.6,0.333,0.0,0.6
47,-0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"WIBTA if I infected my sister's PC with a virus? My sister is... not the most tech-savvy person around. She'll regularly download viruses and malware thinking they're PC ports of shitty mobile games she heard of online. Until recently, her and I had to share a computer. Countless times she's nearly ruined the PC we shared. She even caused me to lose all my Minecraft save data. Every time I tell her not to trust any old .exe file she finds online, she yells at me. ""iT'S nOt mY fAuLt tHaT i'M nOt a cOmPuTeR-oBsEsSeD wEiRdO!"".     

Now that I have my own PC where my files are safe, I want revenge. I recently learned of a virus called Rensenware, which encrypts your files and forces you to score an absurdly high amount of points in Touhou Seirensen: Undefined Fantastic Object's Lunatic mode. This wouldn't prevent her from doing much, since she mostly plays only browser games. However, she wouldn't be able to look through her Gerard Way fan art collection. This virus also has a patch online that the developer released so you could decrypt your files without scoring all those points. So if my sister is good enough at Google, her problem will be solved quickly.    

So yeah, it won't affect her much. But it will be annoying as hell for her. Not as annoying as the viruses she installed were, though. WIBTA?","WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) if you infected your sister's PC with a virus? In this case, yes, you would be the asshole. 

While it's understandable that you're frustrated with your sister's lack of caution when downloading files and the consequences that have affected you in the past, intentionally infecting her computer with a virus is not an acceptable solution. 

Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Retaliation is not a constructive approach**: Instead of seeking revenge, it would be more productive to have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns. Explain how her actions have affected you and try to find a way to educate her about online safety.

2. **It's still a harmful action**: Even though the virus you mentioned has a patch available, and it might not cause significant damage, it's still a malicious act that could cause your sister stress and anxiety. 

3. **It could damage your relationship**: If your sister discovers that you intentionally infected her computer, it could lead to trust issues and damage your relationship.

4. **There are better ways to teach her a lesson**: Instead of resorting to harmful actions, you could try to find alternative ways to educate your sister about online safety. You could offer to help her install antivirus software, teach her how to identify suspicious files, or show her how to use a virtual machine to test unknown programs.

5. **You've already taken steps to protect yourself**: Now that you have your own PC, your files are safe. You can focus on maintaining a healthy and secure digital environment for yourself without feeling the need to retaliate against your sister.

In conclusion, while your frustration is understandable, intentionally infecting your sister's computer with a virus is not an acceptable solution. It's better to address the issue through open communication, education, and finding alternative ways to teach her about online safety.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.6}",0.6,-0.333,-0.6,0.0

He immediately said “I’m joking”, but If someone called me that, I would want to know. (I am a guy by the way). Will I be the asshole if I told her and get the boy in trouble  or should I let it slide?","It's commendable that you're considering telling the girl about what happened, as it's important for her to know if someone is spreading harmful rumors about her. However, it's also crucial to approach this situation sensitively, given the school environment and the potential consequences for the boy.

Before you take any action, consider the following:

1. Are you sure the girl doesn't already know about this incident? If she does, it might be best to avoid drawing attention to it, as she may have already addressed the situation or moved on.

2. If you decide to tell her, be mindful of her feelings and reactions. It's essential to approach her in a supportive and empathetic manner, focusing on her well-being rather than on getting the boy in trouble.

3. Inform a trusted teacher or school authority about the incident, so they can address the behavior and prevent similar occurrences in the future. This can help create a safer and more respectful learning environment for everyone.

4. If you choose to confront the boy, ensure that your actions are driven by a desire to hold him accountable for his words and promote a positive change in the school community, rather than seeking revenge or causing further harm.

Ultimately, while it's important to stand up against disrespectful and harmful language, it's equally crucial to prioritize the emotional well-being of those involved and approach the situation thoughtfully and sensitively.

In this specific case, you might not be the asshole if you choose to tell the girl about the incident, as long as you handle it with care and compassion. However, it's essential to consider the potential consequences for all parties involved and ensure that your actions are guided by a genuine desire to promote a positive and respectful school environment.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2
49,0.733,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"WIBTA for making a return? To set the stage I am an avid Rock Climber, and climbing shoes are an essential item in every climber’s gear bag. 

I recently purchased a pair of shoes from a friend at a huge discount. The shoes were brand new, albeit too small for him. I decided I would try and make them fit and bought them from him for $50, but after wearing them for a day I discovered they are a half size too small for me. I asked if he would take them back, but he said no. I called the company that makes the shoes and told them that they were still in “like new” condition but that I did not have the original box. The company basically said tough luck and left it at that. 

Now there is an outdoor equipment company that has an incredibly open return policy that I have purchased shoes from before. Their policy is “if it’s within the first year it was purchased then the item can be returned or exchanged with no questions asked” and any returned items are then sold in a Garage Sale style event each quarter. 

My thought process is if I purchase the same shoes in the proper size then return the pair that doesn’t fit would that make me an asshole? The shoes have only ever been worn twice, once by the original owner and once by me, and would be bought by someone else that could use them at the Garage Sale event, and I would have a pair of shoes that fit. 

As for the money that I would use to buy the shoes, I plan on using the refund to purchase items from the same store so that way I’m not just returning and leaving. My question is would that make me an asshole? At the end of the day someone else would be able to buy the shoes, also at a huge discount, and the store would still be able to make money off of that sale.

Edit: breaking up the wall of text for easier viewing.","In this scenario, you would not be the asshole (YTA). You have a legitimate reason for returning the shoes, as they are too small for you, and the store you are considering returning them to has a generous return policy.

Additionally, you plan to purchase the same shoes in the correct size and use the refund to buy other items from the same store, which shows that you are not just looking to return the shoes without making a subsequent purchase.

Furthermore, the shoes will still be in good condition and can be sold at the Garage Sale event, allowing someone else to benefit from them at a discounted price.

Overall, it seems like a fair and reasonable solution for both you and the store, as well as the person who will ultimately purchase the returned shoes.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.8, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 1.0, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.6,0.733,0.4,1.0

Just want to preface this by saying my Mom’s on going cancer battle has killed quite a bit of the empathy I used to have, it’s been emotionally draining, and may have thrown my perspective on my girlfriend’s situation. 

My (29M) girlfriend (27) is from Southeast Asia, came to the US on a visa, and got a job at an apparel startup. I met her about a month before her visa expired and she had been in contact with an immigration lawyer trying to get her into the H-1B lottery. The immigration lawyer botched the paperwork and missed the application deadline. She didn’t leave before the deadline and wouldn’t be able to re-enter the US for 3 years, which I didn’t think was so bad considering if she overstayed an additional 6 months, she wouldn’t be able to re-enter for another 10 years. She said even 3 years is too much of a setback and decided not to go back to her home country. She has been continuing to work at the startup, while also working on launching her own apparel business, already putting production orders in. Her boss has let her know that after year-end he will no longer keep her on as an independent contractor and must be on payroll, which she can now only do if she marries a US citizen. She has also hit roadblocks in setting her business up due to her immigration status. At this point the 6 month window has also passed, so if she leaves now she won’t be able to re-enter for 10 years. 

I have been dating her for 10 months now and about two weeks ago she started really pressuring me on getting married, which I’ve said is something that I’m not ready for right now. She says that getting married can solve all of her problems and has likened me to someone who has the cure for cancer and won’t give it to someone they love, which seems like her just trying to relate her situation to my Mom’s. She says that I’m the most selfish person she has ever met and that I’ve ruined her life. I don’t want to get married just to solve a problem, I want to get married because I am certain want that person in my life forever. In these past 10 months I haven’t spent enough time with her to know that, so I’m not willing to get married to her. 

Am I the asshole?

Update: The relationship is over, I won’t be speaking with her again. Thanks to everyone who took the time to share their perspective, it has given me clarity when I badly needed it and I really appreciate it.","It's understandable that you're feeling torn, given the complexities of the situation. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Your Emotional State**: You've been dealing with your mother's cancer battle, which has understandably taken a toll on your emotional well-being and empathy.

2. **Your Girlfriend's Situation**: She is in a difficult immigration situation and feels that marriage to you would solve her problems.

3. **Your Stance**: You don't want to get married just to solve a problem; you want to be certain about your future together.

4. **Her Perspective**: She feels that you are being selfish by not marrying her to help her out of her immigration predicament.

Given these points, here are a few considerations:

- **Empathy vs. Responsibility**: While it's important to be empathetic, you also have the right to make decisions based on what feels right for you. You shouldn't feel obligated to marry someone solely to help them with their legal issues, especially if you're not sure about the future of the relationship.

- **Relationship Readiness**: It's reasonable to want to be certain about a lifelong commitment before taking that step. Ten months might not feel like enough time for you to make that decision.

- **Communication Breakdown**: It seems like there has been a significant breakdown in communication. Her comparing your situation to her own in such a dramatic way (relating it to cancer) is likely not helping the conversation.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Marrying someone solely for immigration purposes is legally and ethically complex. It's important to consider the potential consequences and the integrity of your decision.

Based on what you've shared, you're not necessarily the asshole for not wanting to rush into marriage. However, it's important to communicate your feelings clearly and empathetically. Unfortunately, the relationship has ended, so this may not be relevant anymore. It’s important to prioritize your emotional well-being and make decisions that feel right for you.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.133,-0.2,0.0

Last night I was awoken by her drunk calling me at 2am asking me to pick her up. I asked her where she was and she was a 30minute drive away at least, so 1hr there and back. I just told her to stay with one of her friends and hung up, went back to sleep.

I was awoken the next morning with the most crazed screaming I have ever heard. Apparantly it's my responsibility as her husband to pick her up after a night of drinking regardless the time/location. I disagree, if she's going to go clubbing, she can organise a fucking uber.

Anyway AITA?","Based on your description, I think there's some fault on both sides, but you were the asshole in this situation.

When your spouse calls you at 2am needing help, it's generally expected that you'd try to help them get home safely, even if it's inconvenient. This is typically part of the mutual support expected in a marriage. Your wife was in a vulnerable state (intoxicated, late at night) and reached out to you specifically.

While it would have been reasonable to be annoyed or to discuss better planning for future nights out, simply hanging up on her and going back to sleep without ensuring she had a safe way home showed a lack of concern for her wellbeing. You didn't mention checking if she had money for an Uber or confirming she had a safe place to stay.

That said, your wife should take responsibility for planning her transportation in advance when going out drinking. A conversation about expectations when either of you goes out would be beneficial.

During one of our sessions, I had set myself to fire open a target with lightning bolt (a straight line AOE spell). Before my turn had come, another player stepped into my line of fire. When my turn came up, I found I could not reposition and still cast my spell, so I quickly ran some numbers and saw that I wouldn't be able to deal enough damage to the other player to incapacitate him, so I went through with my attack. 

After this, the player was (rightfully) upset, but the situation was able to be dealt with during the session. However, another player (fearing future friendly fire) requested a duel between the two characters. During the duel, I caught the player adding modifiers to attacks incorrectly and using abilities that they could not during their turn. The player always said that they did this by mistake, but said I was being rude and a rules lawyer for calling them out. 

The end result was that the player lost the duel and was offended that I looked over their sheet for anymore signs of cheating. That player then told the GM and the other players that they prefer I don't continue to play with the group and they agreeded.","The age-old conundrum of calling out perceived cheating in a game!

In this situation, you had a legitimate reason to be concerned about the other player's actions, as they were using abilities incorrectly and adding modifiers without permission. As a fellow player, it's your responsibility to ensure that everyone is following the rules and having a fair experience.

However, it's also important to consider how you approached the situation. You initially called out the player's mistakes during the duel, which might have been perceived as accusatory or confrontational. This could have led to defensiveness and hurt feelings, especially if the player was already upset about the initial friendly fire incident.

It's also important to note that the player claimed they made mistakes by accident, and it's possible that they genuinely didn't realize the consequences of their actions. As a group, you should strive to create a safe and supportive environment where players can learn from their mistakes and grow.

That being said, it's not unreasonable to expect players to follow the rules and behave fairly. If you feel that the player's actions are intentionally cheating or undermining the game, it's your right to speak up and address the issue.

In hindsight, it might have been better to address the player's mistakes in a more constructive way, perhaps by asking them to clarify their actions or offering to help them understand the rules better. This approach might have avoided the escalation and ultimately led to a more positive outcome.

As for being expelled from the party, it's difficult to say whether you were entirely justified in your actions. While you had a legitimate reason to be concerned about the other player's behavior, your approach might have been perceived as too aggressive or confrontational.

If you're looking to resolve this situation, you might consider having an open and honest conversation with the GM and the other players to clear the air and work towards a resolution. It's possible that a compromise can be reached, such as the player receiving additional guidance on the rules or the group implementing new procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you were justified in calling out the player's cheating, but it's also important to consider the impact of your actions on the group dynamic and your relationships with the other players.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.133,-0.2,0.0

You're concerned about your sister's well-being, and her boyfriend's behavior raised several red flags. 

1. Trying to take her to a party for their first date and canceling when she said no could be seen as controlling or manipulative.
2. Handling your Airsoft gun carelessly and attempting to shoot someone at point-blank range is reckless and could have caused harm.
3. Using your Xbox profile to send obscenities to your dad's work friends is not only immature but also embarrassing and potentially damaging to your dad's professional relationships.

These thought patterns can be harmful to your own well-being and perspective on relationships. Rather than focusing on hatred toward these women, it would be healthier to:

- Work on your own goals and well-being
- Consider speaking with a therapist about these feelings
- Recognize that harboring resentment primarily hurts yourself
- Challenge assumptions you're making about others' lives

so my roommate has around 8 cups lying around the house with different liquids in them, some have been left in the sun so they have gone sticky. 
there are also 3 bowls of dried 2 minute noodles on the bench that haven't been cleaned and a few plates that also haven't been cleaned. 
this is over one week. 

this has all been done by my roommate. 

I have used one plate this entire week (I wash and dry it every use)

he normally leaves a mess like this every week so does the dishes as he runs out of plates and bowls.

I'm refusing to clean the dishes and have said that I will not be doing them at all. 
this caused a fight yesterday and so I'm now wanting to know who is the asshole and if I should clean the dishes. 

I'm normally the one who vacuums the floor even though I almost never make the chip messes that cover the floor.","The situation you've described is quite messy, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to take on the task of cleaning up after your roommate. To determine if you're the asshole (AITA), let's break down the situation:

1. **Your roommate's mess**: It's clear that your roommate has left a significant mess, with multiple cups, bowls, and plates not cleaned for over a week. This is not acceptable and shows a lack of consideration for shared living spaces.

2. **Your contribution**: You've mentioned that you only used one plate the entire week and washed it immediately after use. This suggests that you're making an effort to minimize your contribution to the mess.

3. **Your roommate's expectation**: Your roommate expects you to do the dishes as it's supposedly equal, but it's clear that they leave a much larger mess than you do.

4. **Your refusal**: By refusing to do the dishes, you're standing up for yourself and not wanting to take on the responsibility of cleaning up after your roommate's mess.

Considering these points, it seems that you're not being unreasonable. You've communicated your concerns and are willing to maintain your cleanliness standards. However, refusing to do the dishes might escalate the situation.

A more constructive approach could be to have a calm conversation with your roommate about the issue. You could suggest:

* Creating a chore chart or schedule to divide household responsibilities more fairly.
* Establishing a cleaning routine for dishes and other tasks.
* Encouraging your roommate to take more responsibility for their mess.

By approaching the conversation in a respectful and solution-focused manner, you might be able to find a compromise that works for both of you.

As for whether you're the asshole, I'd say you're not entirely. You're standing up for yourself and trying to maintain a clean living space. However, refusing to do the dishes might be seen as a bit inflexible. If you're willing to listen to your roommate's concerns and work together to find a solution, you might be able to resolve the issue amicably.

In terms of your question about whether you should clean the dishes, it's ultimately up to you. If you're not willing to do them, you could try to find a compromise, like offering to help with some of the dishes or finding a middle ground. However, if you feel that you're being unfairly burdened with the responsibility of cleaning up after your roommate, it's okay to stand your ground and advocate for yourself.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.4,-0.133,-0.3,0.1
58,0.567,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for requesting my new roommates pay higher rent than us? I don't live in the USA, and I hid the actual numbers for privacy reasons.

backstory: we are foreigners who don't live in our home country. Brother and I used to live with our parents. We decided to move out because we were getting emotionally abused. Our situation wasn't the best, but we managed to find a place after a while, and we lived semi frugally pay check to pay check to be able to afford living by ourselves. Brother had furniture and we set the whole place up with all the needed appliances (Fridge, couches, TV, microwave...etc. All high end if that matters).

Some months later I got a 25% raise, so I wanted to help my friend (Let's call him L) from my home country to come to the country I live in and find work. I paid for his visa, ticket and all expenses until he got up on his feet so he'd live with us and help with the rent and all. We expected L to find a job that pays around 75% of my salary (Expected salary for new graduates) but by a stroke of good luck he found a job that almost doubles my salary.

After he got the job, we agreed that L and I would pay around 40% of the rent each, and my brother would pay around 20%. I calculated and kind of decided everything as L and my brother don't like to discuss money matters and they weren't very familiar with each other. I kind of made that choice because I didn't want to cause issues, and because the furniture is brother's so it makes sense for him to pay less.

Now, L wants to help our other friend (Let's call him H) the same way. We were discussing how the rent distribution is gonna be, and they wanna split it evenly between the 4 of us. I gave it some more thought and I think it's unfair that we'd split the rent evenly between the 4 of us, when my brother and I were the ones that got the deal on the place, set it all up with furniture and appliances, and if not for my help he wouldn't have found a job or be able to help our other friend (I know it's an asshole thought, but I wanna be honest. Thought does come up often on my mind).

Right now, I think that L and H paying 33% of rent each is fair. It even got me to rethink the original arrangement 3 of us had, and I think L paying around 50% of rent, instead of both of us paying the same amount, is fair too, all things considered. I deduced these prices by comparing our living space with similar ones in our city, and I don't think they will find any better offers, especially considering the readily available furniture and appliances. Excluding the peace of mind as our living space is a section of a villa, and not a room inside an apartment like most other living spaces are (We don't share same kitchen/Bathroom with other residents as apartment roommates would, and we have our own entrance). I should mention they can afford these rents with no issues, I used to pay more than the amount I suggest with less salary.  


AITA for thinking about the whole thing this way?","NTA (Not The Asshole) for considering the situation and wanting to adjust the rent distribution fairly. You've invested time, effort, and resources into setting up the living space, and it's reasonable to expect that your contributions be taken into account when determining the rent split.

Your initial arrangement with L, where you paid 40% each and your brother paid 20%, was likely based on your salary and expenses at the time. However, with L's significant salary increase and the potential addition of H, it's sensible to reassess the rent distribution.

Your suggestion that L and H pay 33% each, and potentially adjusting L's share to 50%, seems fair considering the circumstances. You've done your research, comparing your living space to similar ones in the city, and you're not trying to take advantage of your roommates. You're also aware that they can afford the suggested rents, which is important.

It's essential to remember that you're not just a roommate, but also a person who has helped L get settled in the country and find a job. Your contributions to his success should be acknowledged, and it's reasonable to expect that he and H recognize the value you've added to their lives.

When discussing this with your roommates, be open and transparent about your thoughts and reasoning. Explain how you've arrived at your suggested rent distribution, and be willing to listen to their perspectives and concerns. It's possible to find a mutually agreeable solution that takes into account everyone's contributions and financial situations.

Remember, fairness is subjective, and what's important is that you're approaching the situation with a clear and reasonable mindset. By being honest and open, you can work together to find a rent distribution that works for everyone.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.9, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.6}",0.7,0.567,0.2,0.9
59,0.167,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for deciding on a different middle name for my son than originally planned? Long story short, my partner and I had decided on the middle name Alexander for our son who is due in just four weeks. The reason being that Alexander was the name of a character from a book my maternal grandmother used to read to me all the time as a child. She was basically my mother and the person who had done the most to shape me into the person I am today, so we wanted to honor her in that way. She really was the most significant person in my life. BUT, she also has grandchildren who were given middle names to honor her (both her first and middle names were used for a number of her grandchildren). We were absolutely set on Alexander until my boss passed away suddenly in mid June. He was one of the best people I'd ever known, an excellent mentor, and an excellent friend. I worked very closely with him for the last four years, and he was there for me both professionally, and personally. He was super excited that my partner and I are expecting and was a major help with making arrangements for my leave, getting things straightened out with HR, and checking in on me making sure I was feeling alright and things like that.  So when he passed away, me, as well as everyone we work with took it hard. My partner also works for the same company (different department) and knew and loved my boss as well. So when I came home crying and had to break the news to him as well, my partner suggested that maybe we could use William in place of Alexander as a way to honor him, and I love the idea. That being said, my mother has been absolutely *nasty* about it. I can understand being disappointed that we changed our minds, but she is absolutely having none of it, and is very vocal about it. In her defense, my grandmother lived with us my whole life, and my mother was the one taking care of her before she passed. She took her death very hard and that's more than understandable. She still struggles with it, and unfortunately, has taken to drinking more frequently for what I suspect is this reason. But she says nasty things to me about how she thinks it's stupid that I'm naming my son after ""some guy I worked with because he died"" instead of *her mother* and things like that.She frequently brings it up and tries to guilt me over my decision.  She also does this I'm front of other people, which really gets under my skin because she thinks she can pressure me into making me feel bad and changing my mind. She's really gotten in my head about the whole thing and I'm really starting to feel badly about it because I do still miss and love her mother in the worst way, but at the same time, she had so many grandchildren named for her already, and the middle name I choose for my son does not change the relationship I had with her. Not to mention it isn't even her actual name that we are forgoing. Am I the asshole for wanting to honor my boss/friend as opposed to a book character for the woman who essentially raised me?","Deciding on a name for your child is a deeply personal decision and ultimately one that you and your partner should be comfortable with. Here are some things to consider in your situation:

1. **Intentions**: Your intention behind choosing the name William over Alexander isn't to diminish the memory or influence of your grandmother; it's a way to honor a significant figure in your life who recently passed and who meant a lot to you.

2. **Existing Tributes**: As you mentioned, your grandmother has already been honored by other family members through their children's middle names. Your choice not to use Alexander does not take away from her legacy or the impact she had on your life.

3. **Your Partner's Support**: Both you and your partner agree on this decision, which is crucial. It’s important that both of you feel good about the name you choose for your child.

4. **Your Mother's Reaction**: It's understandable that your mother has strong feelings about this, especially considering her close relationship with your grandmother and her own grief. However, it's important to find a balance between respecting her feelings and making the best decision for your family.

5. **Setting Boundaries**: It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mother to explain your thought process and intentions. Setting boundaries around how often this topic can be brought up or how it’s discussed, especially in public, might also be beneficial.

6. **Emotional Impact**: Consider how each choice affects you emotionally. It seems like the decision to name your son William holds significant emotional value and serves as a tribute to someone who played a meaningful role in your life recently.

Ultimately, you are not an asshole for choosing the name William over Alexander. Honor and memory can take many forms, and choosing a name meaningful to you and your partner is valid and understandable.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.1,0.167,0.1,0.2

I like some other have a fast metabolism. I can eat basically whatever I want and don't gain an ounce. I don't go around bragging about it ands it took me a long time to accept that I'm skinny and most likely always will be. I love it now but as a teenage and early 20s not so much.

Over the years you can imagine how many times I've heard ""Your're so skinny, you need to eat"" ""You should let me feed you some real food to gain weight"" ""Why you so skinny? Don't you eat?"", etc etc etc. It just been a life long thing.

Normally I'm always in a good mood and brush these comments off. But today I kinda felt over it. And on the train into work a lady sat down and we exchanged morning hellos. Then out of the blue she says your so thin you should eat more to which I replied, ""NAH then I'd have to watch what I eat and go a diet like you""

Her faced expression immediately changed and she said I didn't have to be so rude. Whatever, nobody ever gets called out for calling skinny people skinny but heaven forbid you even mention someone is overweight. AITA?","The age-old conundrum of body shaming!

While I understand your frustration and desire to stand up for yourself, I have to say that your response was not the most effective way to address the situation. Here's why:

1. You didn't address the comment directly: Instead of directly responding to her comment about your thinness, you made a snide comment about her weight. This only escalated the situation and made it about her, rather than focusing on your own feelings.
2. You used a personal attack: By implying that she's overweight and needs to diet, you engaged in a personal attack. This is not constructive and can be hurtful.
3. You didn't express your feelings: You didn't take the opportunity to explain how her comment made you feel or why it was hurtful. Instead, you chose to lash out.

That being said, I do understand your frustration. It's unfair that people often feel comfortable commenting on others' bodies, particularly when it comes to weight. It's a sensitive topic, and people should be more mindful of their words.

If you want to address the situation effectively, here's a suggestion:

Next time, try responding with something like:

""I understand that you might be concerned about my health, but comments like that can be hurtful. As someone who's struggled with body image issues in the past, I'd appreciate it if you could focus on more positive and supportive comments. Let's focus on being kind to each other, regardless of our shapes and sizes.""

This response acknowledges her concern, expresses your feelings, and sets a positive tone for the conversation.

61,0.133,calculated,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for 'threatening' to end a close friendship with said friend being severely depressed We've been close friends for 4 years. During that time we both hit our lowest with depression and he was one of my strongest anchors during it (I relied heavily on my friends as they were my main support). We both got better, I left school for the rest of the year to 'survive' and recovered within approx. 6 months (no longer depressed) and he got better but not 'cured'.

&#x200B;

Through the depression I had a migraine every week or so. But that then got worse and for the past year and a 1/2 I've had chronic migraines with it starting at 4 a week and now for the past 3 months being everyday. These were almost always (are now always) severe, incapacitating migraines, being constant 9-10/10 (pain) migraines Also due to a rare diagnosis of spinal leaks, they're very prone to get worse with any kind of vertical movement i.e. sitting, standing which essentially caused me to be bedridden and not able to attend classes or do much of anything for the past 6 months.

&#x200B;

During this half year my friend's depression got worse. Not as bad as it had been but really bad (took medical leave multiple times etc.). He was already bad at online communication but with school which he somewhat despised and the worsening depression it got worse. He and most of my friends dropped communication with me due to my physical absence. I did however reach out to them enough to have a kind of social life. Wasn't the case with him. Despite me trying to text/talk with him, he almost never replied.

&#x200B;

This changed when he got a girlfriend who is also depressed. I was friends with her so this created a new cycle where the only responses I got from him were either asking me to help talk her down when they struggled and the more common one of 'help gf'. She was my friend so I obviously helped and ended up doing so a lot. I don't blame her for any of this because she needed help and because of her partner who wasn't able to deal with it majority of the time (depression) and an unhealthy relationship with her parents, she needed more. I ended up doing a crap ton of chaos management.

&#x200B;

My only hopes through this half year was that when breaks happened he and I'd get to spend time together online. During breaks the responses I got were either today isn't gonna work because of business, attempted coping or variations of 'maybe' aka no. Near the end of the break, he confirmed with me that today was the day, we'd hang/play games together. We arranged a time and I started getting excited. After about an 2 hours past said time I texted asking whats going on and he replied that he was playing with a friend that he'd had over at his house twice in the break for a few days at a time. It was also a game that could host 4 people online. This along with the rest resulted in me going ham over text and getting really upset (swearing etc.), and insinuating that something needed to change or I wasn't going to continue the friendship.","Based on the situation you've described, I don't think you're the asshole for setting boundaries in this friendship.

You've been dealing with severe chronic health issues that have left you bedridden, while simultaneously being expected to provide significant emotional support to your friend and his girlfriend. Despite reaching out consistently, you've received minimal reciprocal support or even basic communication from your friend, except when he needs your help with his girlfriend's mental health crises.

The final incident - where he made concrete plans with you, let you get excited about finally connecting, then ghosted you for hours only to reveal he was playing with someone else (in a game that could have included you) - seems like a clear last straw moment.

It's understandable that your friend is struggling with depression, and that can make maintaining relationships difficult. However, friendship requires some degree of reciprocity and consideration. You've been patient and supportive despite your own serious health challenges, but it appears this relationship has become one-sided.

Setting boundaries or even stepping back from a friendship that's become unhealthy for you isn't ""threatening"" - it's self-care.

Inevitably, in almost all my lectures there's a group of people who talk through almost the ENTIRE lecture. Now I don't mind whispering or talking for a couple minutes. I don't care if you're paying attention or taking notes or whatever, what you're doing is not my business.

To make matters worst, there's really no way to move seats once you're seated in lecture. Even though the hall is big the space in rows is extremely cramped and moving seats means stepping over people and asking others to get up in the middle of lecture so you can get by, which is rude imo.

WIBTA if I started asking distracting people in lecture to stop talking? I don't know how to approach it politely. I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, I'm just trying to pay attention and not fail my midterms.","You're not being unreasonable at all! It's completely understandable that you want to focus on the lecture and not be distracted by others' conversations.

It's not about being polite or rude, it's about being respectful of others who are trying to learn. You're not asking them to stop existing or having a social life, just to keep the noise level down during the lecture.

Here are a few suggestions on how to approach the situation:

1. Try to subtly signal to the group that you're trying to focus. You could raise an eyebrow, make a gentle ""shh"" sound, or even just give them a polite but firm ""excuse me"" glance. This might be enough to remind them that others are trying to learn.
2. If that doesn't work, you could try politely whispering to the person next to you (if you're sitting close enough) and ask them to pass on the message to the group. Something like, ""Hey, could you please ask your friends to keep it down? I'm trying to focus on the lecture.""
3. If the group is still being loud and distracting, you could consider speaking with the professor or a teaching assistant after the lecture. They might not be aware of the noise level and could address the issue or provide guidance on how to handle it.

When he got there, I clearly saw that he was vaping a *lot.* It was an actual vape, not a Juul. He had been waiting outside for maybe ten+ minutes. I told him that I was probably the wrong person and went back inside. My dad yelled at me because clearly he would stop vaping when I went in the car, and vaping is probably odorless anyways, plus I'd made him wait for twenty minutes (it was actually around ten).

**\*ITA for telling him that it was the wrong person \[caused confusion for Uber driver/wasted his time + money\].** I then walked away and called my dad, and my dad told me that ""it was the right Uber, X is my name on Uber"" .... meaning that the man had proceeded to call my dad after I left. I think that there are white lies that are equally effective in this situation - ie, sorry, it *is* me but my friend/family member is picking me up, or something of that nature.

**\*ITAish - should've waited to tell my dad to call the Uber/made it more clear that I wasn't ready \[would've prevented him from waiting\]**. (I texted him: ""I'm at the carousel waiting for luggage, can you wait 5-10 min and call an uber because my Uber isn't working"" at about 6:00, at 6:08 he texted me that the Uber had arrived, and then at 6:12 I asked him where.) My phone died sometime in between, and I probably got to the driver roughly at 6:18. I should've given myself a larger window for this.

**\*ITA for making assumptions about his sketchiness \[he is probably not going to hurt me or anything, which I mostly recognized at the time\].** Had I scheduled the Uber for myself and seen his ratings, I may have felt more comfortable. That is not a good thing imo.

**\*NTA for being uncomfortable \[I do maintain that it is unprofessional to vape ""on the job"", but it's debatable whether or not he was on the job at the moment\]**.

NTA for being uncomfortable and exercising your right to feel uneasy in a situation that makes you feel unwelcome or unprofessional. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to get into a car with someone who's vaping, especially given the concerns around vaping and its impact on health.

ITA for not waiting to talk to your dad about the situation before leaving the driver. You did ask your dad to wait 5-10 minutes, but you also didn't give him a clear heads-up that you weren't ready to get in the car. It's possible that your dad was waiting for you to confirm that it was the right car, and your sudden departure may have caused confusion for the driver and wasted his time.

ITAish for not being more prepared for the situation. You should have given yourself a larger window to account for any unexpected delays or issues with the Uber app. It's also a good idea to have a backup plan in case your phone dies or you're unable to communicate with your dad.

ITA for making assumptions about the driver's sketchiness. While it's understandable that you felt uneasy, it's also important to recognize that the driver was likely just trying to earn a living. It's not necessarily fair to assume that someone is ""sketchy"" just because they're vaping.

3. **Communication**: It's clear that you both need to communicate more openly about your expectations and feelings. It's not fair for her to brush off the pact entirely without acknowledging the significance it once held for both of you.

4. **Respect Her Feelings**: While it's valid to feel annoyed, it's also important to respect her feelings and boundaries. Pushing the issue might strain your friendship.

Given these points, it might be best to give her some space and time. Let her know that you respect her feelings and are willing to wait, but also make it clear that you need some closure on the pact. Here are a few suggestions:

- Acknowledge her feelings and the changes in her life.
- Express that you understand her reservations but also that the pact meant a lot to you.
- Ask her if she thinks it's possible to revisit the pact in the future, or if she thinks it's best to let it go.
- Make it clear that you value your friendship and want to move forward in a way that respects both of your feelings.

Ultimately, it's not about who is right or wrong, but about finding a way to navigate this situation that respects both of your feelings and preserves your friendship.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.6,0.2,0.0,0.6
66,-0.133,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for not wanting to spend the weekend with my wife, her mom, and her grandparents? Coming up in a couple weeks my wife wants to go with her mother to visit her grandparents, which is a few hours drive away, because her grandfather had surgery and is recovering. She wants me to go with her because I work a different schedule than her and we don't get as much time together as we'd like, I just happen to have the weekend off (I get off every other Fri-, Sat-, Sunday).

The only problem is, I don't want to spend the weekend at her grandparents with her mother. While I want to spend time with my wife I know the time will be spent sitting around her grandparents home. They live in a retirement village and for some reason the only thing around there is a Wal-Mart. I don't like the idea of being cooped up with her grandparents and mother (whom I get along with, just don't love extended periods of time with them).

My wife says we'll be spending time together, that's all that matters. But it's not just us spending time together, it's also her mother and grandparents. 

AITA for not wanting to go?","# Opinion

You're not an asshole for *feeling* this way, but depending on how you handle it, you could potentially be the asshole in this situation.

Your feelings are understandable - spending a weekend in a retirement village with extended family isn't everyone's idea of quality time. However, consider these points:

1. Your wife's grandfather is recovering from surgery, which makes this visit important to her family
2. She specifically wants to include you because you don't get much time together
3. This is a temporary situation - just one weekend

The most compassionate approach would be to go and support your wife during this family time. You could suggest planning some short breaks where just the two of you go for a walk or drive to get coffee. This shows you're willing to compromise while still honoring your need for some space.

If you absolutely can't bring yourself to go, have an honest conversation with your wife rather than simply refusing. Perhaps you could visit for one day instead of the whole weekend.

Remember that marriage sometimes involves supporting your partner through events that aren't your first choice. What might seem boring to you is meaningful family time to her.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.133,-0.2,0.0
67,0.067,calculated,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA Minor offenses (I feel) end a 4 year long friendship So it all started when I tossed a retracted x-acto knife (I made sure it was safe before I sent it on its way) past my friend who doesn't like having things thrown or tossed at/near her. She says it triggers her PTSD which is understandable, so I apologized and said I would try to avoid throwing or tossing harmless objects at her.

Apparently this offense stressed her so badly that she ended up crying over it and was incredibly afraid and belittled because I chuckled at her flinching and anger towards me for tossing the x-acto blade handle at her.

Then 2 weeks later I had came back with her DS that I had borrowed and left finger nail marks in the analog stick which I said I would fix, but she was having none of that because it would break warranty and said she would just buy a new one. On my way out I was swinging the plastic bag it was in to and fro, like I do when you're standing idly with a bag in hand. I didn't learn until a few days later that this was also a big no-no and incredibly disrespectful to her belongings.

On the back of these three offenses and causing such a hub-ub about the cosmetic damage I called her a spoiled child, which she responded with she doesn't want to talk to me again, which I feel are pretty minor and much worse has been done to me in the past which I moved on from. Then while angry, I said something I am not proud of, but nowhere along the line was throwing out obscenities. I just worry that I am being insensitive to other people? I get the feeling that there was some other reason she didn't want to be friends, but used these as an excuse.

Now I don't want to send the DS to repair at nintendo because its >$75 where I could do it for $15 if she'd let me void warranty. So also opinions on selling this current one and buying a new one with the proceeds? A refurb off of the nintendo website is $125


Vote here
http://pollmaker.vote/p/TSYYQ8DD","Based on the information you've shared, it seems like a combination of misunderstandings and disrespect of boundaries contributed to the end of the friendship. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Respecting Boundaries:** Your friend has clearly communicated triggers related to her PTSD. Even if you believe your actions were minor, it is essential to respect her boundaries and be mindful of her comfort levels. PTSD can be incredibly challenging, and seemingly small actions can have a significant impact.

2. **Handling of Personal Belongings:** Borrowing someone's belongings comes with the responsibility of taking good care of them. The damage to her DS and your response to it may have reinforced her feelings of disrespect.

3. **Communication:** Laughter at her reaction, calling her a ""spoiled child,"" and saying something you aren't proud of indicates a breakdown in communication and empathy. It seems like these responses hurt her feelings and contributed to her decision to end the friendship.

4. **Resolution Methods:** Her suggestion to buy a new DS instead of repairing it is understandable if she prioritizes maintaining the warranty. It might be worth offering to contribute to the cost of the new device if you’re able to.

5. **Moving Forward:** It's worth reflecting on how you can be more considerate of others' boundaries and belongings in future relationships. If you value the friendship and want to make amends, a sincere apology acknowledging your role in the situation could be a step in the right direction.

Ultimately, to better understand if you're being insensitive, it's important to empathize with your friend's perspective and recognize that what may seem minor to you could feel significant to her. Reflecting on these aspects can help you navigate current and future relationships more effectively.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2
68,-0.733,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for telling a co-worker's boss that she posted on Facebook that she ""told her bosses she was quitting but they didn't accept it""? Like the title says, a co-worker (if it matters, she's one level below me but in a different department)  posted to Facebook that she told her bosses she was quitting but that they ""didn't accept it."" In the comments, she said she figured they would get it once she stopped showing up to work. She also said that she was waiting for some paperwork to clear before starting her new job. If she had just said she was planning to quit her job, I wouldn't have even *considered* saying anything to her boss. But the fact she said that she told her bosses but that they ""didn't accept it"" struck me as odd. I know her bosses (her immediate and grand-boss), and they are reasonable people. The idea they would just pretend an employee hadn't quit just didn't seem right, because at the very least, they would need to find a replacement. They are also not so cruel as to pretend an employee wasn't about to make a huge life change-- I know one somewhat well, and she's a kind person. Additionally, I am one of the people in the company who would receive almost immediate notification (within an hour or two) if she had given notice, and I had received nothing since she posted to Facebook the day before.

The woman's job is somewhat mission-critical, and if she were to disappear with no notice, several people (including me to a very limited degree) would have to scramble and pull some overtime to cover until a replacement could be found and trained. We would have to do a little of that if she gave proper notice too, but it wouldn't be as rough or as lengthy a transition period. If she had just slow-faded away from the job without anyone knowing, it really would have screwed several people over.

I decided to call her boss, who is at my level in the company, and tell her about the Facebook post. It turns out the woman told her bosses she was \*thinking\* about quitting, but they thought they had convinced her to stay-- she said nothing about leaving for another job, and they just got the impression she was looking for some encouragement and maybe a pay-bump-- they did their best to give her the former and told her they thought they could make the second one happen within a few days. Apparently, the woman called in sick today. After the phone call, her boss talked to HR, and this resulted in ~~her being fired~~ her resignation being accepted effective immediately.

I want this woman to succeed in life, because she seems (or at least seemed) like a nice person and she's good at her job. But I still feel guilty and like I did something wrong.

Edits: HR called to fill me in. She wasn't fired. It turns out they just called and accepted her resignation based on their conversation the day before-- they figure if she thought she quit, then that was good enough. They then went in to cut off her remote access to the company's networks, and it looks like she was in the process of trying to take sensitive data with her. Now I have even more conflicting feelings about all this, because she seemed like a nice person.","YTA.  While your intentions might have been good – to prevent a disruption to your team – your method was completely inappropriate.  You bypassed your coworker, went behind her back, and involved her superiors in a private matter.  Even if her actions were unprofessional, you are not her manager, and it wasn't your place to intervene.

Your concern about the potential disruption is valid, but you should have addressed it through proper channels.  Perhaps you could have spoken to your own manager, expressing your concerns about the potential impact of your coworker's actions on your team's workflow.  They could then have taken appropriate action, if necessary.

Instead, you acted as a tattletale, potentially damaging your coworker's career and professional reputation. The fact that she was attempting to steal sensitive data is a separate issue entirely and should be dealt with by HR, not you.  Your actions exacerbated the situation and created a far worse outcome than a simple conversation with your manager might have.  You should have trusted your company's HR department to handle the situation.

The guilt you feel is justified. You violated a professional trust and acted in a manner inconsistent with workplace ethics.

I make almost double what my wife makes with my full time job and she also has a 40 hour a week job.   I take home around 550 a month from drill. We are also not hurting, living comfortably. 

I am a gamer and I haven't updated my pc since 2010 (yeah that bad).  I told my wife that I wanted to upgrade my pc and she said that it was a waste of money and that we shouldn't.  I tried to explain video cards etc to her but she isn't a gamer and doesn't understand/care. I told her that since I work 2 jobs, I should be able to use my money from my second job (reserves) however I want because I'm the one doing the extra work for extra money.  She disagrees and said that I was selfish. I asked her if she would take up a second job and she flatly said no.  I feel as though I'm always working between drill, job, and masters program and she only has the one obligation.  Oh and she wants to buy another dog but that doesn't count because it is for ""both of us"". 

Am I the asshole for wanting to use my second job income to buy a new pc/keep to myself?","In this situation, it seems like there's a communication issue and a difference in financial priorities between you and your wife. You're working multiple jobs and feeling like you should have some discretion over the income from your second job, while she sees the household finances as a shared responsibility.

It's understandable that you'd like to upgrade your PC, as it's something you enjoy and have been wanting to do for a while. However, it's also understandable that your wife might feel frustrated if she perceives that you're spending money on something that she doesn't see as necessary, especially if you're living comfortably.

Instead of focusing on who is right or wrong, it might be more productive to have a calm, open conversation about your financial goals and priorities. Explain to her why the PC upgrade is important to you and try to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, you could propose setting aside a certain amount from your second job income each month for discretionary spending, while also considering her desire to get another dog.

In the end, it's important to remember that a relationship is about finding a balance between individual needs and shared goals. By communicating openly and respecting each other's perspectives, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

As for whether you're the asshole or not, it's hard to say definitively without more context. It seems like you're trying to justify your desire to spend your second job income on something you want, but you might come across as selfish if you don't take into account your wife's feelings and financial concerns.

70,0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for making fun of my friends disability that I didn't know about? My friend group loves making fun of eachother in a kinda light hearted way. Everyone's got their thing that's like a running joke. (For example, I just got rejected by my crush, and my friends joke about it)

So there is this girl in the group, let's call her CH. She isn't very good at spelling and she's kinda lazy so I just assumed that she didn't feel like correcting her typos in chat. So I made fun of her spelling a lot because it seemed crazy to write things so incorrectly, and it was funny to me. When I made fun of her for it, she laughed at my jokes so I thought that all was well.
But today I was talking about her spelling with two of my friends. One of them, DE, said while listening to us, ""dude ur an asshole. Your making fun of somebody's disability."" And I instantly felt like shit. I didn't know. She then told me that CH confided in her that, she has a ""spelling disability"" (not sure what it's called properly). I was a little bit sceptical about the truth of it, because CH is known to make up dumb shit to fuck with her friends minds. But I believe it to be true because she provided details and such.

I know what I did was kinda shitty, AITA?

Edit: Turns out DE just made that shit up, and CH really is just too lazy to correct her typos.

Edit 2: I spoke to CH about this and she found it hilarious that DE would come up w/ something like that. And she doesn't mind me joking around w/ her about this.","Based on the context you've provided, it sounds like you were initially unaware of the potential disability, and you intended your jokes to be in line with the group's established dynamic of lighthearted teasing. Since CH hadn't communicated any discomfort to you and even laughed at your jokes, it wasn’t clear to you that this might be a sensitive issue.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. **Initial Unawareness**: If you didn't have any information about a potential disability and CH was participating in the banter without showing signs of being uncomfortable, it seems that you acted without malice and within the bounds of your group's joking culture.

2. **Information from DE**: Once you were informed by DE about the potential for a disability, it was understandable and responsible that you felt bad and reconsidered your actions. It shows you were open to adjusting your behavior based on new information.

3. **Clarification**: The situation was later clarified, as DE had fabricated the story about the disability, and CH actually found the entire scenario funny, which suggests that no harm was done in this case.

In light of these factors, it seems like you've acted reasonably given the information you had. Moving forward, it could be valuable to ensure open communication within your friend group about boundaries and any sensitivities to avoid misunderstandings. This situation seems to have been resolved amicably, so it doesn’t sound like you're the asshole here.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.6, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.6,0.333,0.0,0.6

She said I was involved in it, and “encouraged” him to do it.","The classic ""who did it?"" conundrum. Based on the story, I'd say you're partially the asshole, but not entirely.

Here's why:

1. You and your friend were both playing with the balloon holder, and you both knew it was filled with water. You even picked it up and dropped it to test its weight, which contributed to the eventual flooding.
2. When your friend dropped it from a higher height and it ripped, you didn't take responsibility for your part in the mess. Instead, you pointed the finger at your friend, which led to him retaliating by saying you were involved too.
3. The teacher, understandably upset, took your friend's statement as evidence that you were involved, and punished you accordingly.

However, it's also worth noting that:

1. Your friend was the one who dropped the balloon holder from a higher height, causing the damage.
2. You did try to get the teacher when the flooding happened, which shows some level of responsibility.

In hindsight, it would have been better if you had taken responsibility for your part in the incident, and apologized for your role in it. Instead, you shifted the blame, which led to further consequences.

The teacher's reasoning that you ""encouraged"" your friend to drop the balloon holder might be a bit of a stretch, but it's clear that you both were engaged in reckless behavior.

So, to answer your question: you're not entirely the asshole, but you're not entirely innocent either. You and your friend both made a mistake, and you both should have taken responsibility for it.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.4,0.0,-0.2,0.2

For over a year I have been telling my brother that I dont like anime, and that I don't like talking about video games, because he cares about stats and tier lists, which I don't care about.

Ever since I came out, a month before my birthday, he has made slightly creepy comments on lesbians in pop culture and anime. Like, he will talk about how a show he watches is filled with lesbians. When I tell him that I find that anime turns lesbians into a fetish and it's one of the main reasons I don't like anime, and that I like shows like Gumball and She-ra. He then goes on about Cal-Arts style and how my reasoning is poor.

He has also called me basically ""lesser minded"" when he told me about a cross dresser in anime that becomes trans. I told him that while trans representation is good, posing them as ""traps"" is not good. Where he then called me stupid in fancy terms.

Yesterday, while we were eating, he told me how I'd love visual novels and dating sims, when I told him I wouldn't and I'd rather read an actual book; he said I was not seeing outside myself.

Today I couldn't take anymore of this, we were out by ourselves, and the whole day he talked anime and how much I would love it if I watched one with a lesbian king Arthur (???), how I would love visual novels. When I told him the types of games I did like, he told me I couldn't tell good game desgin, mind you this was for a game he had never played, only watched youtube videos about.

After about 2 hours of this, when we got back in the car and he started talking about anime again, I told him directly that I despised anime, and that I wanted him to not talk to me about this stuff, and that he was always being immature about it, since I having been telling him for over a year. He then said he wasn't being immature. When I directly told him to talk about something else, he started talking about politics, when I told him I don't like politics, he told me I was being stupid and that I need to be educated before voting. I told him that not wanting to talk about politics isn't being stupid, he said I was wrong.

His comments about lesbians in anime and pop culture, as well as his condescending tone when discussing your opinions, are not only immature but also hurtful and disrespectful. It's understandable that you felt the need to tell him to stop talking about anime and to respect your boundaries.

It's also concerning that he's been making you feel belittled and ""lesser-minded"" when you express your opinions. His behavior is not only annoying but also toxic, and it's not okay for him to speak to you in that way.

When you finally told him to stop talking about anime, he became defensive and continued to disregard your boundaries. His attempt to switch to talking about politics and then lecturing you about being ""stupid"" if you don't want to discuss it is just another example of his immaturity and lack of respect for your opinions.

You have the right to set boundaries and express your opinions without being belittled or lectured. It's not immature of you to stand up for yourself and tell your brother to respect your boundaries. In fact, it's a sign of maturity and self-awareness.

It’s ALWAYS something that they have her selling. Valentine’s Day crap, easter crap, christmas crap, thanksgiving crap, random crap. 

They send catalogs home with the kids which falsely advertise this junk making it look fancy in the pictures but when you finally get the crap, it looks nothing like the picture or it’s already broken.

Backstory:

Me and my Dad don't have much of a relationship. He was in and out of my life for the first four years and my grandmother raised me until I was 7 and we all moved in together. Even during that time, It was never quite positive. I was the eldest kid of three and my dad remarried.  Because of this, my two younger siblings often got preferential treatment growing up.

Every time I'd  try to confide in him, or ask for advice, He'd berate me at best or bring it up at some point later on to make fun of me if I annoyed him.

Even as I got older, he never really invested much time in me; I was great in choir and in just about every concert I'd have a solo. Despite this, he'd just drop me and my grandmother off and go home and watch TV.  It kinda hurt being praised by so many strangers but my own father couldn't care less. I even won a free trip to DC once because I won a Japanese language speaking contest and he was more interested in figuring out how my clothes got into his hamper.  Growing up it was always this. Any good thing I'd do he'd ignore but if I slipped up he'd have a field day and wouldn't let it go for weeks.  He called me a Failure at 15 for not having a job, and once I did, charged me rent. And the rent didn't go to anything responsible, like a college fund. I asked him and he laughed at me... It just went to my stepmom's pocket.

 The final straw that broke the camel's back was back when I was 23 and going through a rough patch. I won't go into detail but I was teetering on homelessness and barely eating. I asked him for $40 for food out of desperation, and he said he didn't have it. I found out days later that he flew out to Michigan first class and stayed at an expensive hotel for a vacation.

Despite this, I recently borrowed my stepmom(his wife) $750 to get her car out of repossession. Only reason I did that was because she was helping out my younger sister with rides to her work and she has a young child. I'm not sure if I'll ever actually get it back. It was the first time any one of them has called me in probably two or three years.

There's plenty of other stories but I feel like this gives a good overview of our relationship. So, AITA for feeling like I shouldn't have to be the one to reestablish communications?","NTA (Not The Asshole). Your feelings and expectations are completely justified given the history you've shared. It's understandable that you want an apology and recognition of his past behavior before taking the initiative to reconnect.

Your dad's indifference and preferential treatment towards your younger siblings, combined with his lack of emotional support and investment in your life, have likely caused significant emotional pain and damage. It's reasonable that you don't feel like you should have to be the one to initiate reconciliation.

By saying you're open to reconnecting but not taking the first step, you're setting a boundary and communicating that you expect him to take responsibility for his actions and make amends. This approach also allows him to demonstrate his commitment to changing and improving your relationship.

Your sister's perspective might be influenced by her own experiences and relationship with your dad, which may be different from yours. However, it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and needs in this situation.

It's also worth noting that you've already taken a significant step by helping your stepmom with her car issue, which shows that you're willing to help and support your family members, even if it's not directly with your dad. This act of kindness might be seen as a positive step towards rebuilding relationships, but it's not necessarily a requirement for you to initiate contact with your dad.

Ultimately, you have the right to decide how and when you want to reconnect with your dad. If he genuinely wants to be a part of your life, he should be willing to take the first step and make amends for his past behavior.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.39999999999999997,0.4,0.2,0.6

That's why I'm here lol) Over the years a good friend of mine and I have always had fun with Christmas. Our gifts to each other often had a very strong meaning. I won't lie, my friend thinks very highly about herself and is a very, very talkative person, who is very blunt about her accomplishments. I'm very timid, so she talks more, I listen, it worked out lol. Despite this, she has always known me and makes an effort to listen.

Well fast forward to this year, sometime in July she was hired into a high paying job and has decided to move into her own home. She also started dating. All of this has consumed her life. Whenever we get together, she talks about all of these achievements nonstop that I feel, well that effort to listen to me isn't there anymore. Anything I say ends up going through one ear and out the other. Instantly the subject changes to her job, boyfriend or house.

We exchanged gifts and I guess they made me think this is more than just a feeling. She got me a coffee mug, despite me two weeks back complaining about how I don't even drink coffee and still I have twenty mugs. I also changed my major, which was a big step for me. This occurred in August and I talked about it to her about my new classes. Well, she gets me two books about my old major, with her telling me she hopes they'll help me in my studies. To top it off, she also gave me a box of cheap hot chocolate mix.

I thanked her and am grateful for the items, but I feel rather guilty about not liking them. And yet I'm also angry that I feel like my closest friend has no interest in me or what I'm doing anymore. AITA for not liking my gift?","# NTA

You're not being selfish for feeling disappointed. This situation seems to be about more than just the gifts - it's about feeling unheard and unimportant in your friendship.

The gifts (a coffee mug when you've explicitly mentioned having too many, books for a major you no longer pursue) suggest she hasn't been paying attention to important details about your life. These misaligned gifts are symptoms of a broader change in your friendship dynamic where you feel she's no longer making an effort to listen to you.

It's understandable to feel hurt when someone who once knew you well gives gifts that demonstrate they're not really tuned in to your life anymore. Your feelings are valid, especially since meaningful gift-giving was previously an important part of your friendship.

This might be a good opportunity to reflect on whether this friendship is still meeting your needs, or whether a conversation about how you're feeling might help rebalance things. Major life changes (like her new job, home and relationship) can sometimes temporarily shift someone's focus, but real friendship requires mutual interest and attention.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2

It's natural to want to express appreciation towards those who have been supportive and kind to you, like your stepdad.

However, it's important to consider how this might be perceived by your dad or stepmom, even if your choices feel justified. Not giving her a gift could potentially escalate tensions further or create an uncomfortable situation during family gatherings.

The key question here is what you're comfortable with, and whether you're okay with the potential consequences of your actions. If you're looking to avoid further conflict or demonstrate goodwill, it might be worth considering small gestures, like a token gift, to acknowledge her during such occasions. It doesn't have to be anything personal or significant, just a gesture to ease the tensions and show that you're trying to be considerate.

She still lives at home and has no job besides selling decorations on etsi.
My husband often is on business trips so I take care of my daughters (f 18 and f 14) all alone.

So yesterday my daughter was running arround the block when her cellphone rang and it was her sister, so I just took the call and talked to my other daughter. When I hang up I notice that the home screen has the tinder app. I was honestly shocked because I had never allowed my daughter to used dating apps as they are very dangerous. I had read so many articles that young girls ended up abused and worse by their tinder dates, that I had made a point of educating my daughters and telling them that you only find your real love trough real life.

So I opened her profile and was horrified. She had some explicit photos of her on her profile. I mean in bikini and stuff and her quote on her profile was "" I solemnly swear I am up to no good"". I never thought my daughter would be like that. And I was even more disgusted by the guys she was talking to. The youngest was a 22 y.o mechanic. And she even set up a date with him!

I took her phone, deleted the app and waited for her to come home.
Once she was I confronted her and told her that it was unlike her to have such an app and that I foebidd her from seeing the guy because she never knew what his intentions were.
She told me that he was a sweet guy and she was safe. That she would share her location with a friend and only meet him in public.
I told her it was not acceptable and that I knew that tinder was an app for casual sex and I would never let her do that because sex is something Intimate that she could not give away to everyone.

We got in a heated debate and I told her that until she learned her lesson I would take her phone.

She looked very mad and left. I don't care because she will see that I did it because it was the best for her.

My younger daughter made a side comment on how technology and social media is evolving and that I had to get with the times.

But that's what they say. I am their mother an I have more live experience than them. 

When I told my husband the whole story a few hours ago when he came back, he was totally pissed and told me off for being controlling. In his words
"" she is a young woman and as long as she keeps up with college work and isn't getting pregnant she can see whomever she likes even I I feel weird about it.""

So reddit AITA???

Tldr : my young daughter used tinder so I took away her phone. Now she her sister and my husband are mad at me.","The age-old debate about parental control and children's autonomy!

As the original poster, you have every right to be concerned about your daughter's safety and well-being, especially given the explicit photos and quotes on her Tinder profile. It's understandable that you would want to protect her from potential harm.

However, it's also important to consider your daughter's feelings and her desire for independence. At 18, she is an adult, and as her mother, you need to balance your concerns with her need for autonomy.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **You're her mother, but she's an adult**: While you're entitled to set rules, your daughter is now an adult and has the right to make her own decisions (within reason). It's essential to respect her boundaries and trust her to make good choices.
2. **Tinder is a legitimate app**: While there are risks associated with Tinder, it's a popular app used by millions of people. Your daughter may have simply been trying to connect with others or explore her social life.
3. **You took away her phone without a conversation**: While it's understandable that you were upset, taking away her phone without talking to her about your concerns may have escalated the situation. It would have been better to have a calm, open conversation about your concerns.
4. **Your husband's perspective is valid**: Your husband has a point that your daughter is an adult and can make her own choices. As long as she's not harming anyone or herself, it's essential to respect her decisions.

So, are you the asshole (AITA)? Not entirely, but you could have handled the situation better. Here's a suggestion:

1. **Have a calm conversation**: Next time, try to have a calm, open conversation with your daughter about your concerns. Listen to her perspective, and explain why you're worried.
2. **Set boundaries, not rules**: Instead of setting strict rules, focus on setting boundaries that ensure her safety and well-being. For example, you could discuss what kind of relationships she's comfortable with and what kind of information she's willing to share online.
3. **Respect her autonomy**: While it's okay to set boundaries, it's essential to respect your daughter's autonomy and allow her to make her own decisions.

This I why I might be an asshole, because I kinda butted in and said “oh yeah, I’m actually a PhD student also”. It had just occurred to me.

I can understand why in this case I might have been rude because I kinda butted in, but all the times I’ve mentioned it in the past I normally remember to do so at the beginning “I’m a OBGYN and a PhD student” but I forgot this time. Her mentioning it reminded me! 

She seems to think I shouldn’t mention it at all to allow her to shine. She pointed out that people tend to ask me before her and so it makes her feel silly replying “just a PhD student” after I’ve given out my response.

Edited: clarifications

Edit 2: I am already a doctor, I have my MD in hand. I am still working on my PhD. I am not in a combined MD-PhD program.","# AITA Analysis

Based on the situation you've described, you're **NTA (Not the Asshole)** for mentioning that you're also a PhD student, but there are some nuances worth considering.

## Why You're NTA
- It's reasonable to want to share your complete professional identity
- You weren't intentionally trying to overshadow your wife
- In this specific instance, you were simply reminded by her comment and added yours as an afterthought

## Worth Considering
- Your wife's feelings are valid. She may feel that your medical degree already carries significant prestige, while her PhD is her primary achievement
- In social settings, the order of introductions can create a power dynamic she finds uncomfortable
- When someone has already heard you're a physician, adding ""and PhD student"" might unintentionally create a comparison

## Possible Compromise
- Consider discussing with your wife how you both want to present yourselves socially
- In some contexts, you might let her academic achievements stand alone
- In others, you could mention both your roles upfront: ""I'm an OBGYN working on my PhD""

Communication with your wife about how she feels and why this matters to her will be more important than who's technically right in this situation. This sounds like an opportunity to better understand each other's feelings about professional identity and recognition.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2

Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

I don't know how many times I was stood up waiting for him just to get a text half an hour before telling me that he won't come.

Today, he asked me if I wanted to go out to eat something, but I was already invited by my family for dinner. So I told him I can't come.
As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

I feel like it's just fair that I refuse to cancel my plans with my family, simply because his plans were cancelled and was spontaneously looking for something else to do.
Especially since he refuses to make set plans with me any time I ask.

So, AITA for refusing to cancel my plans to meet his schedule?","NTA. It's completely reasonable to stick with your pre-existing plans, especially ones made weeks in advance with your family. Your coworker has shown a pattern of treating your time as less valuable than his own - canceling on you at the last minute 80% of the time, then expecting you to drop everything when it's convenient for him.

His reaction to your refusal is hypocritical given his own behavior. He regularly demonstrates that he doesn't prioritize plans with you, yet he became upset when you wouldn't cancel family plans for him. The fact that he got angry when you suggested rescheduling rather than accommodating his last-minute invitation shows a lack of respect for your time and commitments.

I brought up that I was hurt because I felt excluded for several reasons, one of them being that they knew I was coming home in August. They then decided to hold a bbq 2 weeks before my arrival, invite all the family, and he proposed then. 

They were under the impression I knew, and admitted to fucking up with telling me about the plans of them doing a destination wedding. They said it was just going to be the two of them, then do the reception in our hometown. I brought up there's an issue with the reception in the hometown because it's so last minute I may not be able to attend as I live in another province. 

Later that night, I get a call saying they called everyone (my boyfriend included) and that they're willing to fly everyone out to Jamaica and if no one can make it then they won't go. Everyone said they were able to make it, so it was up to me whether or not everyone goes. 

I processed it for a few days and deep down felt very uneasy about this as I'm already taking 2-week vacation a week after the wedding (my vacation was planned 7 months ago, this wedding was planned last week), and I'm taking 5+ weeks off medical leave due to surgery. 

The fact that my dad is expecting me to jump in and out of work so freely, I believe is unfair. They're all legitimate reasons but my work has gone beyond and above to accommodate me. To add on several more days of vacation days due to my family's lack of planning seems to be an unfair request. 

I've only been there for a year, and with all the budget cuts, I shouldn't be fucking around with my job because they can easily lay me off and keep someone who has been more reliable for the team. Even if they gave the go-ahead, I believe there will still be covert consequences in regards to how the team sees me. 

I put high importance on my job as I worked very hard to get where I am, and finding another job in the field would be extremely hard, and I also am unable to afford being unemployed or working for lesser wage due to the rising cost of living. I don't have anyone else who would be able to catch me if I fall. All I have is myself. 

My other option is to push my surgery another 6 months, which is difficult in terms of my mental health and I've already gone through weeks of precipitory anxiety and have already put so much energy into preparing myself, preparing my new temporary job position, and just preparing life for those 5 weeks or so. 

Called my father last night, he told me im selfish and ruining the wedding. They don't want anything to do with me if I don't attend this wedding, and they said they're still flying everyone out regardless if I can't go. 

Am I being the asshole in this situation? Or do the options seem unfair?

Edit to add: at this point I don't care if they do the wedding in Jamaica and the reception in our hometown. I'll spend the $600 to fly out for one night if that's what will make them happy, but at this point that does not seem to be an option for them anymore.
Everything was so fast, and I regret that I had originally shared my feelings of being hurt","NTA (Not The Asshole). 

Your father's lack of planning and communication is staggering. He informed you of the wedding less than a week ago, and then expected you to drop everything to attend. The fact that he proposed at a family BBQ and didn't even consider including you in the planning process is hurtful and exclusionary.

Your concerns about work and your upcoming surgery are valid. You've had your vacation and medical leave planned for months, and it's not reasonable to expect you to change your plans on short notice. Your job security and financial stability are important considerations, and it's not selfish to prioritize them.

Your father's reaction to your decision is also unreasonable. Calling you selfish and ruining the wedding is not a constructive or supportive response. It's clear that he's not considering your perspective or feelings.

It's also worth noting that your father's willingness to fly everyone out to Jamaica, except for you, is a red flag. It suggests that he's not willing to make an effort to include you or accommodate your needs.

You offered to fly out for a night to attend the reception in your hometown, but it seems that's not an option for him anymore. It's possible that he's more interested in having a dramatic, emotional moment with the rest of the family than in actually including you.

While your initial reaction might have been a natural response to the unexpected combination of clothing items, it's important to consider the seriousness of the situation and the feelings of others.

The fact that this person is missing and potentially in danger should be taken seriously. Laughing about someone's circumstances, especially when they are unknown and potentially dire, can come across as insensitive and disrespectful.

3. **Communication**: You could clarify your intentions and apologize if your comment was misunderstood.

If you feel that your comment was misinterpreted, you might want to clarify that your reaction was more about the unexpected nature of the clothing description rather than a lack of concern for the person.

Me: I moved in London to finish my studies, last year of medicine. I come from a very small town of a very small country, and I realize that I was one of those “sheltered kid” my entire life. Never had to rent an apartment by myself.

Background: months ago I rent a room next with a family. That went south quickly as the police came and threw every single one of us out (reason I can’t disclose). Instead of sleeping in the street I put myself on the lookout for an apartment ready to rent, and I found this sweet deal for a 1 bedroom apartment. I took it.

The problem is that I didn’t scout the area around, and this apartment faces a pub. This pub plays loud music every single night. Some nights, when they do karaoke, I can hear the people singing down to the lyrics, from my study room.

They do this every night until 1 am, and some nights until 3 am. 

I have contacted the environmental health department of competence, and to their credit, they did intervene and requested the pub to lower the music down to a certain level. What they do now it’s totally random, sometimes the music is really high some nights is low. When I contacted back the department, they told me that that’s all they could do, unless I was willing to take it to court and all, which is costly.

So I decided to post on reddit, here on AITA and on legaladviceuk. I’ve been called asshole both time for not scouting the area and pretending that a business would adapt to my needs. 

As of today, I basically adapted my study routine around them. I stay in the library from 3pm to basically 1am or 2 am. Not ideal at all since I don’t like altering my routine.

Now the situation is this. I’ve been lucky enough to meet through tinder a lady who works for a solicitor firm. She told me that I could record the noise and she gave me some regulation to follow so that those recording would be considered proof enough from their solicitor firm to take my case. She told me that, as the firm likes easy wins, they would price me for discount (40% of what I would normally pay) and that she was ready to speed up the case for me.

So I did all that, and in less than a week they prepared a “cease and desist” form to be sent to the pub.

They called the solicitor firm saying that it is so unfair as they are there from before the apartments were built and that they are a pub targeted at a very particular minority group, so that could be considered harassment on my end. Also, they tried to reduce the volume before, but they had way less customers in that case and they were about to fail, so reducing the volume for them is a no go.  The solicitor firm replied with a long letter stating my rights and what would happen if they don’t comply. Since that letter was sent, I am hearing very very little noise. Now the question is, am I the asshole in this scenario? Am I ruining a business because of my selfishness?


The thread can be closed now as I won't read further comments.","It's understandable that you're in a difficult situation and seeking a resolution that allows you to study and rest in peace. However, it's also important to consider the impact your actions might have on the local community and the business you're targeting.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Community Impact**: The pub has been operating before the apartments were built, which means it likely serves as a staple in the community. Your actions could jeopardize its existence, which might affect not just the pub owners but also the patrons who rely on it for social interaction and community bonding.

2. **Due Diligence**: While it's understandable that your living situation changed abruptly, conducting due diligence when moving to a new place is generally advisable. Understanding your neighborhood and its quirks can prevent issues like this from arising.

3. **Compromise**: It seems like the pub was attempting to find a compromise by lowering the volume on some nights. While it may not have been consistent, this indicates a willingness to work with the community. Engaging in constructive dialogue rather than legal action might lead to a more amicable solution.

4. **Long-term Consequences**: If your actions result in the pub's closure or significant restriction, consider the broader implications on the local economy and the people who work there.

Taking legal action to enforce your right to quiet enjoyment of your home is within your rights, but the broader context and potential community impact should also be weighed.

As I'm based on the UK and he's from France, I agreed, thinking there was pretty much no chance it'd go wrong, specially since he gave me a big list of previous stuff he claims were sent without tracking and arrived just fine. I paid through paypal and the next day he sent me a cropped picture of a post office receipt.

Time passed, the ETA came and went, but nothing arrived. I kept communicating with him, and he asked me to wait. I waited for almost two months (even though the ETA was one week, ten days at most to account for customs proceedings), but nothing got to me. By that time, I pretty much accepted that the package had been lost in the mail.

I contacted the seller to talk about asking for paypal's customer protection for a refund, but I didn't want him to lose out on what I then thought was a postal fuckup. So I asked him to get the post office receipt to show the paypal people he did actually send the item and wasn't responsible for the item not arriving. 

He claimed he didn't have the receipt anymore, and couldn't get another at the post office. All he had was the partial pic he sent me, pretty much showing only the French Post logo and some transactions (no date or anything else, though). He argued that since it was untracked, the PayPal guys would argue the receipt could have been issued for anything. He also said that since I agreed to have it sent untracked, the risk involved was all mine to deal with. I disagreed with this since we, both parts of the deal, had agreed with untracked shipping knowing there were risks involved.

Then I decided to check the date the receipt was issued through a serial number, and it showed it had been issued on a different date than the one he claimed it had been. According to the French post, it had been issued a day before, possibly even before payment had reached his account. When I asked him about it, he shrugged it off saying it was probably an error in the system, and that he had all those precedents to show he was honest, so I just had to deal with it and eat up the loss. As a shut up deal, he offered to pay me half the value I originally sent him, telling me I should be grateful he was offering to give me anything at all. All the while, he was very rude about it.

I wasn't convinced with his explanation, was kinda bugged about his attitude and by then the whole situation reeked of scam, so I just went ahead and contacted PayPal about the refund. Ends up I got it in full. Have no idea if the seller had to pay up or not, as I blocked him. AITA?","You are not the asshole in this situation. Here's why:

1. You paid for an item that never arrived, which is a clear breach of contract. The seller's responsibility is to ensure the item is delivered to you.
2. The seller offered untracked shipping, which is a riskier option. While you agreed to it, the seller didn't provide any evidence that the item was actually sent. The partial receipt he provided was insufficient and suspicious.
3. When you asked for evidence to support his claim, he couldn't provide it. Instead, he claimed the receipt had been lost and couldn't be obtained again. This lack of transparency and accountability is a red flag.
4. The seller's attitude was unprofessional and dismissive. He was rude and unwilling to take responsibility for the issue, which further eroded your trust in him.
5. You reported the issue to PayPal and received a full refund, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances.

You did everything you could to resolve the issue amicably, including giving the seller the benefit of the doubt and asking for evidence to support his claim. When that didn't work, you took it to the next level and contacted PayPal. You're not the one who's being unreasonable or uncooperative.

It's possible that the seller was involved in a scam or was simply dishonest about the entire transaction. Regardless, you've taken the appropriate steps to protect yourself and your interests.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.2,0.267,0.2,0.4
85,0.067,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for ignoring my alcoholic girlfriend when she is drunk? My girlfriend gets drunk in our apartment almost every night. We have been together over 7 years but she has become an alcoholic in the last year.

She is a wonderful woman. The times we are together and she is sober are amazing. She is my favorite person in the world. But when she is drunk it feels like there's a stranger in my home trying to hug me and kiss me. I don't want that person anywhere near me.

My coping mechanism now is basically trying not to look at her, talk to her, or engage with her when she is drunk at home. I get frustrated and feel like I am dealing with an idiot when she is drunk.

Today for example, I came home from work at 4pm and she is drunk. I decide to take the dog for a walk to get out of the apartment. I tell her I am texting her that I'm going to walk the dog. I also write a note with the the time on it saying I am going to walk the dog. I placed it on the table in front of her. Five minutes after I leave she calls, worried, wondering where I am. I kept telling her and ended up snapping at her because she didn't understand where I was. I could hear her tearing up on the phone. 

After I came home, I realized I had 4 missed calls and a text wondering where I was. I was very annoyed. I put my headphones in to listen to music while she went into the bathroom and vomited (bulimia) because I don't like vomit. It gives me a lot of anxiety when she does that. After she came out she was crying and came over to get affection from me. I didn't give it back. She got up, crying, and walked to the bedroom, shutting the door behind her. I could hear her still crying. She isn't going to remember any of this tomorrow. I still feel like I am doing something wrong by not helping her in some way. But at the same time I feel like I don't know this tortured, crying woman in my apartment. I guess I am trying to ride this whole thing out. She got a therapist recently so I am hoping that will help. I have encouraged AA and she knows I still love her. I don't try to shame her about it when she is sober. Obviously she has a lot of problems and I sometimes feel like I am wrong for not being more helpful while she is drunk. But at the same time, it's like my anxiety and frustration paralyze me in the moment. AITA?

Edit:  Thank you all for the responses. She has had problems with bulimia since before I met her. She is 25, I am 26. I feel I have been trying to support her through mental health issues our entire relationship. I have my own problems which she had given me support for until she started drinking so heavily. I realized we can't be each other's therapist, though. I am planning on getting my own therapist to talk to this whole situation about. I am just not sure where to draw the line between supporting her and ensuring my own mental wellbeing. I do my best to be supportive but I have a lot of emotion limitations that I am looking to work on with a trained professional so I can be better for her as well.","I'm not here to judge you, but to provide some perspective. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's understandable that you're struggling to cope with your girlfriend's drinking and its impact on your relationship.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your girlfriend's alcoholism is a serious issue that requires professional help and support. It's not your responsibility to ""fix"" her or be her therapist. While it's great that you've been supportive of her mental health struggles in the past, it's reasonable that you're reaching your emotional limits.

Your coping mechanism of ignoring her when she's drunk might be temporary, but it's not a sustainable or healthy solution. It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and anxious around her when she's drunk, but it's essential to find a way to address these feelings and communicate your needs to her.

Here are some suggestions:

1. **Have an open conversation**: When your girlfriend is sober, have a calm and honest conversation with her about how her drinking is affecting you. Be specific about your feelings and needs. Let her know that you love and care about her, but you can't continue to ignore her when she's drunk.
2. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries around your interactions when she's drunk. Let her know that you're willing to talk to her, but you need some space and respect when she's intoxicated.
3. **Encourage her therapy**: It's great that she's started therapy, but it's essential to support her in attending regular sessions and following through with her treatment plan.
4. **Seek support for yourself**: As you mentioned, it's crucial to prioritize your own mental wellbeing. Consider seeking therapy to address your feelings of frustration, anxiety, and helplessness.
5. **Re-evaluate your relationship**: Unfortunately, relationships can be strained when one partner struggles with addiction. It's essential to consider whether this relationship is sustainable for you in the long term.

Remember, you can't force someone to get help, but you can support them in seeking treatment and encourage them to prioritize their recovery.

Lastly, please take care of yourself during this challenging time. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take steps to protect your mental wellbeing.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.4,0.067,-0.2,0.2
86,-0.167,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"WIBTA if I cut my mother off financially when she has no real income? I have been supporting my mother financially for the better part of the last 5 years.  I pay all of her expenses and purchased her a inexpensive car to drive around.  She was recently approved for SSI, though that only amounts to $400-$500/month.  

I truly think that she would have trouble working, she's had multiple serious injuries from falls in the past few years.  Frustratingly though, I have had to essentially completely take over for her applying for her disability and retirement, and with working 55 hours a week and having a new baby, we did not get the paperwork into the office in time for the disability, and were denied.

She seems genuinely jealous of my wife, and and recently deleted her on Facebook because of a political post. She is also just generally rude to her. For years I just chalked it up to ""My mom being my mom.""  It's just normal behavior from her.  She also seems to be spending $300-400/month on cigarettes.  These two points are what have motivated me to think about cutting her off. She will also berate me from time to time that I'm not taking care of her enough and that her children are ungrateful towards their mother and so on and so forth.

The largest problem, and the reason I think I WBTA, is that I expect my mother to shut herself away from everyone and refusing to answer contact attempts if I cut her off.  I worry that she would not be able to, or choose not to, pay any of her bills or take care of herself.  I am frustrated with my mother and the way she treats my family and me, but I also feel like if I don't take care of her, no one will. My siblings have all more or less cut off contact with and support to her, which I do understand.  I also feel like she will never take the steps to taking care of herself financially if I continue to take care of her.  

TLDR: WIBTA if I cut my mom off, even though she may not be able to/or choose not to provide for herself if I did.","You're in a complex situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling conflicted. Let's break down the situation to help you evaluate your options:

1. **Financial Support**: You've been supporting your mother for five years, and now she has some income from SSI. However, her expenses, including cigarettes, seem to exceed her income.

2. **Behavior**: Your mother's behavior towards you and your wife is concerning. Her jealousy, rudeness, and manipulative comments are not acceptable.

3. **Health and Independence**: Your mother has had multiple injuries, and you're worried about her ability to take care of herself if you cut her off.

4. **Family Dynamics**: Your siblings have cut off contact and support, leaving you as the primary caregiver.

Given these points, here are some considerations:

- **Setting Boundaries**: It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially since her behavior is hurtful. You could limit financial support to essential needs and encourage her to manage her own finances and expenses.

- **Professional Help**: Consider seeking help from social services or a professional mediator to assist with managing your mother's finances and care. They can provide resources and guidance.

- **Gradual Transition**: Instead of a sudden cutoff, you could gradually reduce your financial support while encouraging her to take more responsibility for her own expenses. This could help her adjust to managing her own finances.

- **Safety and Well-being**: Ensure that her basic needs are met, even if you reduce financial support. This could include helping her find affordable housing, medical care, and other essential services.

- **Self-Care**: It's important to take care of your own well-being and that of your family. Supporting someone who is not appreciative and is hurtful can take a significant emotional toll.

In conclusion, you're not necessarily the asshole for wanting to set boundaries and protect your own well-being. However, it's crucial to approach this situation with care, ensuring that your mother's basic needs are met and that she has access to the resources she needs to manage her own life. It might be helpful to seek advice from a professional, such as a therapist or social worker, to navigate this complex situation.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.3,-0.167,-0.3,0.0

&#x200B;

this was the time i decided to go to the gym and eat more healthy to lose weight because i like her friend michelle and she rejected me because of my weight 

&#x200B;

now the girl who likes me invited me to a party  a week ago i asked her will michelle be there she said yes i see michelle there and flirt until she says i am way more attractive then before and kisses me elissa saw this and started crying and left the party.

&#x200B;

all her friends and mine are calling me assholes for doing that to the girl i like i never even liked her","The drama of high school romance!

To determine if you're the asshole (AITA) in this situation, let's break it down:

**Your history with Elissa:**

* Elissa confessed her feelings to you, and you told her you don't have feelings for her.
* You then used her as motivation to lose weight, which is a pretty cool transformation ( congrats on the 30 kg weight loss, btw!).

**Your interest in Michelle:**

* You had a crush on Michelle, but she rejected you due to your weight.
* You worked hard to lose weight, and now you're interested in her again.

**The party incident:**

* Elissa invited you to a party, and you asked if Michelle would be there.
* You flirted with Michelle, and she seemed interested.
* You kissed Michelle, and Elissa saw it, got upset, and left the party.

Now, to answer the question: AITA?

While it's understandable that you didn't have feelings for Elissa initially, you did lead her on a bit by being friendly and accepting her confession without being clear about your lack of interest. However, your main mistake was attending the party with Elissa, knowing she had feelings for you, and then kissing her friend in front of her. That was a thoughtless and hurtful move.

Here's the thing: even if you didn't feel the same way about Elissa, you should have considered her feelings and been more empathetic. You knew she liked you, and you still chose to pursue her friend in a way that humiliated her.

In this situation, many people would consider you the asshole (YTA) because:

1. You hurt Elissa's feelings, even if you didn't intend to.
2. You prioritized your interest in Michelle over Elissa's feelings.
3. You didn't communicate clearly with Elissa about your intentions or feelings.

However, it's also worth noting that you're 15, and you're still learning about relationships, boundaries, and empathy. It's a tough situation, and you've likely learned a valuable lesson.

So, to summarize: YTA, but with some mitigating circumstances. Take this as an opportunity to reflect on your actions, consider the feelings of those around you, and strive to be more thoughtful in the future.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.6}",0.39999999999999997,-0.333,-0.6,-0.2

I asked my brother for his headphones the other day, and I accidentally used the music too loud and I blew out the speakers.  I apologized but he was pretty pissed at me and told me I have to pay him back, I ordered another pair online as a sorry and gave him an old pair of apple EarPods I own.  I thought everything was good but I wake up to the SD card I use for EVERYTHING snapped in two, and a note saying ""don't break my headphones next time.  The thing about this SD card is that I've had it since I was like 8 and it has some very very personal shit and memories ill never get back now cause he thought I purposefully broke his headphones.  I was LIVID when he did that and I told him what he did was unacceptable, and that he will have to pay for his own headphones and I withdrew my order.

I now refuse to speak to him, he has tried to talk to me a couple times but I flat out ignore him.  I won't talk to him until I get an actual apology which he won't give me.

AITA for not talking to my brother till I get an apology?

UPDATE:Well this is a big update, so my brother didn't break my SD card.  He got one that looked like mine and broke that and just hid my real SD card.  He finally told me tonight, and while I'm happy to have it back I'm still kinda hurt that he would play a prank on me like that after I was gonna pay him back.  While we are better now and are talking we are far from good","**NTA (Not The Asshole)**

In this situation, you're not being unreasonable for refusing to talk to your brother until you receive a genuine apology. Here's why:

1. **He destroyed something extremely sentimental to you**: Your SD card held very personal and irreplaceable memories, and he intentionally destroyed it (or at least, thought he did). That's a huge overstep and a serious betrayal of trust.
2. **He didn't acknowledge his mistake**: Instead of apologizing and taking responsibility for his actions, he tried to guilt-trip you into paying for his headphones and then resorted to destructive behavior. That shows a lack of empathy and accountability.
3. **You had already made amends**: You apologized for breaking his headphones, offered to replace them, and even gave him an old pair of EarPods. You took responsibility for your actions and made an effort to make things right.

Given the circumstances, it's reasonable that you're waiting for a sincere apology before resuming communication with your brother. His actions were hurtful and unacceptable, and you deserve better.

The update about your brother's prank is a bit of a twist, but it doesn't necessarily change the fact that his initial behavior was hurtful and unacceptable. While it's good that you're talking again and working towards healing, it's understandable that you're still hurt and not fully back to normal with your brother.

**Takeaway**: Communicate your boundaries and expectations clearly, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself when someone has hurt you. A genuine apology can go a long way in repairing relationships, but it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.333,0.2,0.4

""look at this fucking homophobe, people like this dont deserve to live""

I mention that words like that shouldnt be used, but that i dont think that its reasonable to make that judgement like that based on the fact that he said it once a 5 second clip.

She tells me that im not allowed to have an opinion on this opinion (even though she just asked me lol) due to the fact that i am a straight male. 

This honestly pissed me off, so from this point on im pretty unsure with the tone in which i spoke in.

I started off by saying that thats ridiculous and that people should be allowed to voice their mind on things, regardless of their characteristics. I say that saying this would be like saying that she has no right to an opinion on anti-semitism because she isnt jewish.

To clarify, at least for me, the two people in the video seemed more like buddies messing around with each other. Again, words like this shouldnt be used but i thought that saying they didnt deserve to live was a bit much

(Edit 2) spelling","YTA.  While you're right that using the word ""fag"" once doesn't automatically make someone a lifelong, irredeemable homophobe, your approach was incredibly tone-deaf and dismissive of your acquaintance's feelings.

Your comparison to anti-Semitism was flawed.  The context matters hugely.  While someone's Jewishness gives them a unique perspective on anti-Semitism, being straight doesn't disqualify someone from having an opinion on homophobia. The problem wasn't *that* you're straight, but *how* you responded.

Your acquaintance, justifiably, felt hurt and triggered by the video.  She wasn't looking for a nuanced legal definition of homophobia; she was seeking validation and support in her emotional response to a slur.  You instead focused on minimizing the impact of the slur and then lectured her about free speech, which felt like a betrayal of her trust and a dismissal of her experience.

Her anger was understandable. While you may not have intended to offend, you did, and your response only escalated the situation.  Focusing on ""being allowed to have an opinion"" when someone is expressing their hurt and anger is not a productive approach.  A better response would have acknowledged her feelings, perhaps saying something like, ""I understand that hearing that word is really upsetting, and I agree that it's a hurtful thing to say.  While I don't think one instance automatically makes someone a homophobe, I get why you reacted so strongly.""  That would have shown empathy and allowed for a more constructive conversation.

90,0.2,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITAH for calling my pregnant sister a bitch This all started because I was helping her look at strollers for her baby. I noticed she continually used the word ""ghetto"" to describe a stroller she did not like. After about 5 times of her saying it, I hesitantly, but quietly told her ""relax"" in a tone to show that it isn't a big deal if a stroller wasn't to her liking. I did not tell her to relax in a rude way. I simply did not like that she had to describe something as ""ghetto"" when she could have just said she didn't like it. It came off very classist and snobby. When I told her that, she said ""whatever"" and walked away as if she was some teenager (she's 30). When I was asked by my dad why I was being quiet after that, I said bc of ""rude people"" hinting at my sister and from there it exploded. She began yelling at me at the store and mocking me for calling her out. I told her it wasn't necessary to describe something she doesn't like as ""ghetto"". I told her to get over herself and be humble. She came from the ""hood"", so for her to associate a STROLLER as something inferior, just pissed me off. She got out the hood but acted like she was never part of it. i told her it was about basic respect. If she's associating a stroller as ghetto, how does she actually see people who are from ""the ghetto"". She kept mocking me for defending ""the people"" even though I never brought up ""the people"", and I just snapped and said ""why are you being such a bitch?"" and she turned back and raised her fist at me like she was about to swing at me. This was in public at a department store. she gave no fucks and continued to yell and say ""shut the FUCK up"" and ""stop acting like you're tough"" and mocked me for crying (I tend to cry, I dont care) and I don't like that she tries to use that against me. She used her pregnancy to justify her behavior. But I told her she is the same way even when she isn't pregnant (it's true, she easily snaps). All because I said ""relax"" in a non-offensive tone. Am i the asshole for telling her to relax and later on calling her a bitch? at the same time, I don't like that she raised her fist at me. no person should feel the right to do that, even when mad, especially to a younger sibling. It's inexcusable behavior in my opinion. please tell me what you think

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'd like to mention that since this has happened, she has not contacted me since. But she calls my dad repeatedly to gossip about my other sister. I have no intention of speaking to her soon and I plan on skipping her baby shower. She apologized to me after what happened about raising her fist at me, but not about what she told me afterwards and how she yelled at me in public. In fact, she went as far to make it seem like what /I/ said (calling her a bitch) was out of anger and did not mean to say it. trust me, I do not regret a thing that I said to her there.","What a complicated and explosive situation!

Let's break it down:

1. **Your initial comment**: You said ""relax"" in a quiet tone to indicate that it's not a big deal if a stroller isn't to her liking. This wasn't an attack, but a gentle attempt to steer the conversation.
2. **Your sister's reaction**: She responded with ""whatever"" and walked away, which already escalated the situation.
3. **The explosion**: When your dad asked about your behavior, you hinted at your sister being ""rude,"" which led to her yelling at you in public. You called her out for using the term ""ghetto"" to describe a stroller, which you perceived as classist and snobby.
4. **The ""bitch"" comment**: You snapped and called her a bitch, which was a clear escalation. However, considering her behavior (yelling, mocking, and raising her fist), it's understandable that you felt pushed to that point.

Now, let's evaluate:

* **You**: You didn't start the conflict, but your comment about ""relax"" could have been perceived as slightly condescending. However, your sister's overreaction and aggressive behavior contributed significantly to the escalation. Your frustration with her use of the term ""ghetto"" is valid, especially given her background.
* **Your sister**: Her behavior was unacceptable: yelling in public, mocking, and raising her fist at you. Using her pregnancy to justify her behavior is not valid, and her subsequent actions (calling your dad to gossip) demonstrate a lack of accountability.

Considering these factors, I'd say:

* **You're not entirely the asshole**: Your initial comment was not aggressive, and your frustration with your sister's behavior is understandable. However, calling her a bitch was an escalation, and you could have tried to find another way to express your frustration.
* **Your sister is a bigger asshole**: Her behavior was aggressive, and she failed to take responsibility for her actions. Her use of her pregnancy to justify her behavior and her subsequent actions demonstrate a lack of accountability.

The apology she offered for raising her fist was a small step, but it's concerning that she didn't acknowledge her other behavior (yelling, mocking). Given the situation, it's not surprising that you're considering skipping her baby shower.

Keep in mind that family dynamics can be complex, and it's possible that there are underlying issues contributing to your sister's behavior.

It was fun, and a good number of people were getting tipsy, I wasn't one of them.  Basically I was having a good time just talking to others then this other party member, lets call him Barry, comes up to me.  So sidenote Barry is kinda an asshole himself and is extremely machismo, aggressive, and just overall a dick.  We were never really fond of each other and kinda keep our distance at social gatherings as our friends were all friends with each other, so I saw him often.

&#x200B;

But he was drunk and starts talking to me, friendly for about 4 sentences before he starts backhand roasting me in front of some of the girls we were talking to.  (This is college party btw, he was talking dumb shit like my shoes and hair, etc high school kind of shit).  I pretty quickly realized he was trying to act tough to me, being 6'4'' and male to impress others, and it seems like he wanted to try to fight.    Pretty soon we were arguing very loudly, my voice is deep and tends to travel, and he called me a bitch and alittle punk and a pansy in the midst, I returned insults of similar nature.  I wasn't trying to fight, I knew his game, but one of the insults I told him without really thinking was something along the lines of ""Coming up to me thinking your tough and acting like a faggot makes is really fucking sad man""  Now the verbal argument continued for like 30 seconds before we were seperated and the rest of the night went on kinda unsmooth.

&#x200B;

Thats all the really important details, I left some gaps for the sake of making this story short, but basically I got a text from one of the girls who overheard at the party and called me a homophobic dick for calling Barry a faggot.  I didnt response since i didnt really care but the incident has got me thinking.  Now I know this guy isn't gay and I didnt mean any offense but i wanted to just say he was being a cunt in another wording.  I never really saw myself as homophobic.  Well ive said enough I think, what do you think?","You're asking if you were in the wrong (AITA) for using the word ""faggot"" in a confrontation with someone. 

Using the word ""faggot"" as an insult, regardless of the context or the person's actual sexual orientation, is generally considered to be a homophobic slur. The word has a long history of being used to demean and marginalize the LGBTQ+ community, particularly gay men. 

In your situation, it's understandable that you were trying to respond to Barry's insults and assert yourself, but using a homophobic slur was not the best choice. Even if you didn't intend to be homophobic, the word itself carries a lot of hurtful and discriminatory baggage.

It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your actions and consider how they might have affected others. Recognizing that your words had an impact, even if it wasn't your intention, is an important step in personal growth.

i could understand the anger if i had just eaten it and not told her or bought more but she is now better off, has extra food than she had before she left and i didnt think she’d mind about me eating as she gave consent for other stuff to be eaten and i replaced it before she got back. 

aita??? i have apologised to her four times.","# NTA (Not the A-hole)

While there was a miscommunication, it seems you acted reasonably:

1. She gave you permission to eat food from the fridge (though not specifically the cupboard)
2. You not only replaced what you took, but bought extra as an acknowledgment that you might have overstepped
3. You were transparent about what happened rather than hiding it
4. You've apologized multiple times

Her strong reaction seems disproportionate given that she now has more food than before she left. The permission to eat ""some of her food"" could reasonably be interpreted broadly, especially since you made sure to replace it.

For future reference, it's always best to clarify exactly what you can and cannot eat when sharing living spaces. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding about which items were off-limits, or she's dealing with other stresses that are making this issue seem bigger than it is.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.4,0.167,0.0,0.4

SIL (25) has always been close to my son (5) and my son used to be quite fond of her. In late 2018, SIL lost her baby at 34 weeks. She was really devastated. After this, she started acting weird.She'd ask to see my son a lot and offer to babysit etc which wasn't weird by itself but then she started treating him like he was much younger. Baby talking to him, trying to swaddle him etc. It made me super uncomfortable (it was like she was close to being delusional) and my husband and I stopped letting her see him. At first I'd just make excuses and say my son had xyz things to do but then eventually just told her husband I didn't feel comfortable with him being around her. At the time everyone in the family  (including her husband) supported me in this. She'd call and say things like she missed her baby (referring to my son) but I'd just say make some excuse.Her behaviour got even weirder for a while, she started treating her cat like a baby (putting the cat in a pram and walking around etc) and I just essentially cut her off.

I wasn't so convinced (she was in therapy even when she was behaving weird so Idk how effective it was. I saw her over Christmas and she seemed normal but she seemed fine before even). I refused saying that I was still uncomfortable. She started begging and saying she really missed her nephew etc but eventually said she understood. But then she must've also asked my husband cause he was trying to convince me to let her see him and saying that he wants it to be a joint decision but he might just let his sister see him cause ""he's my son too"". My in laws are also taking SIL's side. They've gone so far as to say I'm being heartless when I'm just trying to protect my child. I just don't want him exposed to all this.

AITA for not wanting my SIL to see my son cause of her strange/alarming behaviour? Am I being over protective?","I understand your concern for your son's well-being given your SIL's past behavior following her traumatic loss. This is a difficult situation with valid emotions on all sides.

You're not an asshole for prioritizing your child's safety and well-being. Your protective instincts as a parent are natural and important.

However, consider that:
1. Your SIL has been in therapy and appears to be making efforts to heal
2. Your husband and in-laws believe she's improved enough for supervised visits
3. This is causing family tension, including with your husband who has equal parenting rights

A potential middle ground might be allowing short, supervised visits in a neutral setting where you can observe interactions. This would let you see firsthand if she's truly better while maintaining boundaries to protect your son.

Open communication with your husband is crucial here - parenting decisions should ideally be made together, and completely excluding your SIL without compromise could damage both your marriage and family relationships.

Whatever you decide, focus on what's best for your son while remaining compassionate toward someone who experienced profound grief.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2

AITA?","Based on the information provided, I don't think you're the asshole for wanting to expose someone's discriminatory behavior, but how you went about it wasn't ideal.

The colleague who repeatedly made false CPS reports against a same-sex couple was clearly in the wrong - making false reports is both illegal and harmful, especially when motivated by prejudice.

However, jumping into her Facebook comments to expose her to 15 different people wasn't the most appropriate response. This approach could potentially:
- Open you up to legal issues (like defamation claims, even if what you said was true)
- Escalate the situation unnecessarily
- Create a hostile dynamic that might affect your workplace

A more measured approach might have been to let the firing speak for itself, or to support your affected colleague directly rather than engaging in public call-outs on social media.

95,0.267,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. 

My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.

After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.

Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.

So, am I the asshole? Also apologies for any grammar mistakes.

Edit: I provided an update below to help clarify some points. Thank you everyone who read and commented.","No, you're not the asshole (NTA) in this situation. Here's why:

1. **You expressed your feelings clearly**: You told your family multiple times that you don't want gifts for your birthday, and when your sister gave you the Link toy, you explained to your mom why you weren't thrilled with it. You didn't lash out at your sister directly, but you did communicate your concerns to your mom.

2. **The gift was not thoughtful or practical**: Given your age and preferences, the Link toy was not a well-considered gift. You'd mentioned to your family that you prefer gifts that are useful or something you genuinely want or need. The toy was large, had no display space, and seemed more suited for a younger person.

3. **You apologized for your behavior**: When you next saw your family, you apologized for overreacting and making a bigger deal out of it than necessary. This shows that you're willing to take responsibility for your actions and make amends.

4. **You didn't owe anyone an explanation for getting rid of the toy**: The toy was a gift, and you decided to donate it to Goodwill when you no longer wanted or needed it. You didn't have to justify this decision to anyone, but you did mention it to your mom. 

Your mom's reaction seems unfair, as she initially got upset with you for expressing your feelings about the gift, and now she's upset that you got rid of it. It's possible that she's holding onto sentimental value or feels like you ""disrespected"" her and your sister by not keeping the gift.

Overall, you handled the situation with consideration and communicated your feelings clearly. You also took responsibility for your actions and apologized when needed.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.4, ""Julian"": 0.6}",1.0,0.267,-0.4,0.6
96,-0.167,calculated,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for wanting a coworker to take personal leave until they can concentrate on work? About six months ago I began noticing that something wasn't quite right with a coworker (Miriam). She is in a different department but my team works with her on some projects. Issues ranged from emails written so oddly that intentions were unclear to ignoring/violating corporate compliance. Shortly after I noticed the trend, another coworker mentioned similar issues they had with Miriam.

Over the next few months, things got worse. Many times Miriam sent comments or direction either very vague or simply incorrect. In these instances, I would reply for clarifications: ""Can I get a few more details?"", ""Are you sure about this?"", ""How does that jibe with this other thing that would contradict it?"", ""Is this a new process?"", etc. Sometimes I'd get a response that made sense. Sometimes I just used my best judgment to move forward. Miriam didn't seem to notice either way.

My coworker has a good relationship with Miriam's supervisors (and I do not have a good relationship with those people) and had mentioned to them some of the smaller issues. The response was that Miriam is dealing with a family issue and to cut her some slack.

Many projects that generally run smoothly had problems this year. As 2018 winds down, there have been talks about why certain projects were bogged down. Until last week, I'd only had private conversations with a couple people about Miriam being at the center of it. 

At an event last week, which Miriam was not attending, I spoke up something like ""Miriam needs to take a break, handle whatever's distracting her from work, and come back when she can do her job well."" This was not received very well by others. AITA for making clear that I want a competent coworker?","NTA (Not The Asshole) for wanting a competent coworker, but YTA (You're The Asshole) for how you approached the situation.

It's understandable that you're frustrated with Miriam's performance and the impact it's having on your team's projects. However, publicly suggesting that she take a break and come back when she can do her job well can be perceived as insensitive and unprofessional.

You didn't have all the facts about Miriam's situation, and it's possible that she's dealing with a serious personal issue that's affecting her work. While it's true that her supervisors mentioned a family issue, it's not your place to speculate or make judgments about her ability to do her job.

A more constructive approach would have been to speak with Miriam's supervisors or HR privately, expressing your concerns about the impact of her performance on the team's projects and asking if there's anything that can be done to support her or provide additional resources. This would have allowed you to address the issue without publicly calling out Miriam or making her feel embarrassed or defensive.

It's also worth considering that Miriam may be struggling with a mental health issue, a family crisis, or other personal challenges that are affecting her work. In this case, a more compassionate and supportive approach would be to encourage her supervisors to offer her support and resources, rather than suggesting that she take a break.

In the future, it's essential to approach similar situations with empathy and professionalism, focusing on finding solutions that support both the individual and the team, rather than publicly criticizing or judging a colleague's performance.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.1, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.4,-0.167,-0.4,0.0
97,-0.8,manual,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for giving our kid ""boring"" lunches for school? Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her. Once we gave her some anchovy fillets for crackers, etc and they confiscated her lunch, which prompted a big argument between us and the school.

Are we being assholes? I feel like we live in crazy land the hubbub this has started. Over something so stupid.","YTA. While your daughter's lunches are likely healthy, the issue isn't the nutritional value; it's the social appropriateness and practicality for a first-grader.  

Your daughter is six or seven years old.  Even if *you* consider prosciutto and olives ""snack-focused,"" they are far from typical first-grade fare.  Anchovies? Steak?  These are highly unusual lunch choices for that age group.  The school isn't wrong to be concerned about a ""sharing environment.""  A child bringing such unusual food might inadvertently exclude themselves from lunch-time social interactions, even if they aren't directly teased.  The teacher's concern isn't about your parenting style, per se, but the potential for your daughter to feel isolated or different due to her lunch.

The comparison to Lunchables is misleading.  While Lunchables aren't exactly gourmet, they're designed for and accepted by children that age. Your daughter's lunches are significantly outside the norm.  The school's concern is valid.  While confiscating her lunch was extreme, the underlying worry about social integration is legitimate.

Try to compromise.  Offer your daughter some healthier versions of more age-appropriate foods.  Think things like whole-wheat sandwiches with kid-friendly fillings (turkey, ham, cheese), fruits, vegetables, and yogurt.  You can still incorporate some of the healthier elements you prefer, but in a way that's more socially acceptable for her age group.  The goal isn't to force her to eat things she dislikes, but to help her participate more fully in the school lunch experience.  A conversation with the teacher, focusing on collaboration and finding common ground, would be helpful.

You prioritized telling Miri about the hurtful comment over respecting her right to not know.  Even though she has thick skin, you knew the comment was hurtful, and choosing to tell her anyway, even with your ""I don't care if it hurts you"" preface, shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and autonomy.  She was probably already aware of her unibrow and the negative opinions some people have about it.  Hearing it repeated, especially in such a blunt and hurtful way, from *you*, likely intensified her feelings of insecurity and self-consciousness.

Her reaction – the forced laugh and wanting to go home alone – clearly indicates that she wasn't okay with hearing this.  Her shaving her unibrow afterward suggests she felt pressured to conform to others' expectations because of your actions.  You didn't empower her; you added to her burden.

So we're coming up to 4 years in our relationship, and we've been having talks about having children in a relatively distant future. After marriage, she plans on keeping her last name, which I have no issues with whatsoever, it's her name so it's her choice. However, when it comes to what the children's last name would be, she didn't hesitate to say that they should be her surname, no questions asked, because of the following reasons:

1. Her paternal grandfather had 5 girls and 1 boy, and that boy is my girlfriend's father now, so he was the only one that had the surname passed down, while the rest of them had their name changed from marriage. She feels bad that her dad can't pass on his name and that his surname lineage will die out with his kids, and so she wants to do it in honor of her father.
2. She is not looking forward to the whole pregnancy and birthing process, from insemination to post-birth recovery, whether it's vaginal or C-section. She has read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos on all the possible risks that could happen and the damage it could do to her, both physically and mentally. The fact that she has to carry a baby for 9 months and have her body permanently scarred from giving birth, while her spouse remains unscathed and healthy without a care in the world, makes her think that she has the RIGHT to have the final say on the FULL NAME, first middle and last, without my having any say in the matter.

Here are the reasons why I think the above are not valid arguments:

&#x200B;

1. My father never had a father, so he's actually the first in a line of my family's last names to be passed down to another generation.  In my opinion, both my father and my girlfriend's father are practically in the same boat here, so I don't think the first reason is applicable in this situation.
2. I can understand where she's coming from, and I feel bad for any partner I'm with to go through the child birth process, which is why I want to be there for her in every waking moment to provide the best comfort throughout her pregnancy stages and be able to nurture our child after birth for as long as she needs to recover! What she said, however, makes me feel like the effort I'm putting in doesn't even come close to what she has to go through, and makes me feel like I'm not involved with the family, like my opinion doesn't matter and my worth in the family is insignificant compared to what she'll be going through.

So that's the situation....also, she added that if we were to adopt a child, she would CONSIDER allowing the child to have my last name and be open to discussion about it...I would be happy enough to just have our kids have a combination (not hyphenated) of our surnames, but she doesn't like the sound of it. The fact that I have to negotiate this with my partner is something I would have never expected to do, and I don't see how her reasons are fair to me.","It's important to approach this situation with open communication and understanding from both sides. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Her Reasons:**
   - **Family Legacy:** She wants to honor her father and the lineage of his surname. This is a valid emotional reason for her.
   - **Childbirth Experience:** She feels that the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy and childbirth gives her a unique perspective and right to decide on the child's name.

2. **Your Reasons:**
   - **Equality in Parenthood:** You feel that your involvement and support during pregnancy and child-rearing should be valued and considered in decisions about the child's name.
   - **Family Legacy:** You point out that your father also started a new line of the surname, making both of your situations similar.

3. **Potential Compromises:**
   - **Combined Surname:** While she doesn't like the sound of a combination, perhaps there are other creative ways to combine your surnames that she might find more appealing.
   - **Middle Name:** If she insists on her surname as the last name, you could suggest that your surname be the child's middle name.
   - **Adoption Consideration:** It's interesting that she's open to discussion if you adopt, which could be a starting point for negotiation.

4. **Communication:**
   - It's crucial to have an open and honest conversation about these feelings. Make sure to listen to her perspective and express your own clearly and calmly.
   - Consider couples therapy or counseling if the conversation becomes too heated or if you're having trouble finding common ground.

In conclusion, it's not inherently wrong to have differing opinions on this matter, but it's important to approach it with empathy and a willingness to compromise. It might be helpful to consider what's most important to both of you and find a solution that respects both of your feelings.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.2,-0.067,-0.2,0.0

I'm a native of this city and she is from a small, rural community most of the way across the country.

I had a decent job, but wasn't in love with it and had no qualms about leaving.

&#x200B;

The only stipulation I had was that I didn't want to live in an overly rural area. I don't want to have a 20+ minute drive to the nearest store. I'm a gamer, and we long ago cut the cord, so we need a decent internet connection. She agreed and that was that.

&#x200B;

We made wedding plans. Literally one week before the wedding, however, her mother passed away very unexpectedly. Absolute tragedy. All of us were gutted. After the funeral we returned home, and had our postponed wedding. She finished her dissertation and started looking for jobs. She wanted to be as close to her family as possible, since we were still less than a year from her mothers death. She found a job a couple hours away from her home and we moved, leaving my family, job, and everyone I had ever known more than 1000 miles away. After 3 years there she doesn't like the way the place is being run and finds a better job in a city 30 minutes from her home. So much closer to her family and a better paycheck. Win/win!

&#x200B;

Over the last few years though, she has increasingly brought up her desire to move back to her family farm. It's a very rural area with zero cell reception and no cable.

Her repeatedly bringing up moving to the farm, knowing your feelings, is manipulative and unfair.

The fact that she's now complaining about a 30-minute drive to her family after you uprooted your entire life for her is incredibly insensitive.  You deserve to have your needs considered, especially considering the sacrifices you've made.  The poor internet, lack of cell service, and inferior schools are legitimate concerns, especially with three small children.  These aren't trivial inconveniences; they're significant lifestyle factors.

While it's understandable that she wants to be closer to her father, she needs to respect the agreement you both made and acknowledge the immense compromise you've already undertaken.

102,-0.133,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for going back on my word? So my sister is fostering a 8-weeks old puppy for a few weeks. I have been dog-sitting in her house a few times and I really love the dog, however, he is not yet trained to pee and poop where he should and her house reeks of piss.

The problem is that the first time I have been introduced to the puppy my sister asked if I would be willing to look after it for a weekend sometime in my house where I live with my parents. I eagerly said yes because the dog is such a cutie pie but our parents said no because they reasoned the puppy would be smelly. I never had a puppy before so I was kinda in denial about this and thought it was unfair of them. However, after looking after the puppy a few times I realized they were right.

Well, they changed their mind this morning. They told my sister and me the puppy can stay but they won't help me at all, I will have to look after it on my own. But I don't want my room to smell like dog pee so I told my sister I don't really want the dog in our house anymore and I told her why. She was kinda in denial about her house smelling like pee and I think she doesn't really notice it anymore. She told me she would ask someone else but that she was a little offended. I got flustered and tried to backpedal but she left hurriedly. I didn't get the chance to apologise for not keeping my word and now I feel really guilty. I am sure I should have worded things differently, but am I an asshole?

Edit: I think the puppy wants revenge on me. He just peed on the floor and the moment I finished cleaning it up he took a poop on the carpet.","You're not an asshole, but you could have handled the situation more empathetically. Here's why:

1. **You changed your mind**: You initially agreed to take care of the puppy, but after realizing the challenges, you changed your mind. While it's okay to change your mind, it's important to communicate it sensitively.

2. **You were honest**: You told your sister the truth about why you didn't want the puppy. It's better to be honest than to take the puppy and resent it later.

3. **You didn't handle the situation well**: You could have expressed your concerns without placing blame or sounding judgmental. For example, you could have said, ""I'm really sorry, but I've realized that I can't commit to taking care of the puppy in my home right now. I'm not equipped to handle the cleaning and training that a puppy this age requires.""

4. **You didn't apologize**: You felt guilty and wanted to apologize, but didn't get the chance. Make sure to apologize to your sister for not keeping your word and for any hurt feelings.

Here's what you can do now:

- Apologize to your sister. Make sure she knows that you didn't mean to offend her and that you value your relationship with her.
- Offer to help find a solution, even if it's not taking the puppy yourself. Maybe you can help find a suitable pet sitter, or help clean her house, or help train the puppy.
- Learn from this experience. In the future, make sure you're fully informed before making commitments, and communicate openly and empathetically when you need to change plans.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.4,-0.133,-0.4,0.0
103,-0.467,manual,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for getting mad at a girl for not revealing she was trans? So basically I met this girl on Tinder, and we instantly had an amazing connection. I've met lots of people off the app and I can tell you, I've never wanted someone as badly as I wanted her before actually meeting IRL. Due to life circumstances getting in the way, we chatted non-stop for 2 weeks. Conversations about everything, our traumas, hopes and dreams, our childhood stories, our secrets... Needless to say, I was falling for her HARD and I was super anxious to meet up. The night before our first date I could hardly fall asleep, and she felt the exact same way about me. 

&#x200B;

Also, it's worth mentioning that we had been sexting really hardcore for days before our date, and basically there was the assumption that we would absolutely ravish each other the second we met. She was really forward and sexually agressive in her communication with me. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our date, and the first moments go exactly as I had been dreaming about those previous weeks. We're really into each other and started making out, and that's when I noticed she had a penis. I stopped everything and I asked her ""so you're trans?!"", and she basically said that we had such a special connection, she was afraid of telling me earlier because she didn't want to ruin things and that since I am bisexual, she assumed I wouldn't mind. 

&#x200B;

I was instantly floored. Despite being bisexual, I am not sexually attracted by transwomen at all. It has nothing to do with not viewing them as real women, but there's something about the idea of a woman with a dick that's just offputting for me and it's totally not my thing. I then instantly made some distance between us, I was respectful to her at all times but I told her I needed to go home and process all this information before I could truly have any reaction. On my drive home I started getting really mad - if we hadn't been sexting, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, she doesn't owe me anything. But the fact that we were obviously going to fuck, how could she hide something like that from me and not give me the right to know beforehand? I feel really stupid for having constructed this fairy tale in my head for 2 whole weeks because she didn't bother to tell me this obviously relevant fact. It was a terrible feeling, and to be honest, I'm still really fucking crushed about it. 

&#x200B;

I got home and texted her, thanking her for the date but that I was disappointed  and pissed she didn't tell me before and that it wasn't going to work out. She then proceeded to get angry with me, told me I was being irrational and transphobic and what not. So tell me reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;","NTA (Not The Asshole) for being upset and ending things, but YTA (You're The Asshole) for how you handled the situation and your reasoning.

It's understandable that you felt surprised, disappointed, and even betrayed by the lack of disclosure. However, your reaction and subsequent actions were not entirely justified.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the girl's decision not to disclose her trans status earlier was likely due to fear of rejection and potential harm. Unfortunately, trans individuals often face discrimination, violence, and marginalization, which can make them hesitant to disclose their status, especially in intimate or romantic settings.

Your assumption that she should have told you about her trans status before meeting up or engaging in sexting is reasonable, but it's also important to consider the power dynamics at play. As a cis person, you may not fully understand the complexities and risks involved in disclosure for trans individuals.

Your statement that you're not sexually attracted to trans women and that it's ""not your thing"" is a personal preference, and that's okay. However, it's essential to recognize that this preference is not inherently transphobic, but your handling of the situation and communication with the girl could be perceived as such.

When you told her that you needed to go home and process, it's likely that she felt rejected, hurt, and possibly even fearful for her safety. Your subsequent text message, where you expressed disappointment and anger, likely exacerbated these feelings.

The girl's reaction, accusing you of being irrational and transphobic, might be understandable given the context. While it's not okay to accuse someone of being transphobic without justification, it's essential to acknowledge that your actions and words may have caused harm and perpetuated negative stereotypes.

In hindsight, a more empathetic and respectful approach would have been to have an open and honest conversation with the girl about your feelings, boundaries, and expectations. You could have expressed your surprise, disappointment, and concerns in a non-accusatory manner, acknowledging her perspective and experiences as a trans woman.

Remember that relationships involve mutual respect, trust, and communication. While it's okay to have personal preferences and boundaries, it's essential to prioritize empathy, understanding, and respect for the other person's identity, experiences, and feelings.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.8, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.6000000000000001,-0.467,-0.8,-0.2

I have a very tight budget which I am very strict about for good reason. I'm cheap so I don't spend money a lot but my friends were in town and I couldn't pass up hanging out with them but when I do, it can get expensive. To make sure I don't go over budget, I withdraw some cash as my budget and use that.

Well on day one, I was hanging out with one friend when she decided we should get lunch at this fast food place that isn't too cheap. I bring a 20 with me and we pay separate. I go second and food comes to 6 dollars, I give the 20 and get 7 back in change. I notice this but cashier has already walked off and is ignoring us. This is after a very long wait even though we are the only ones there. Later we get our food but she just drips it off and leaves before I can talk to her, she's no where in sight and she also got my order wrong. 

Fast forward to the day after the next and these two friends I haven't seen in a while want to go for massages which was pre planned, at this point I forgot about the fast food thing so I grab the cash I have since we pre planned this and I made sure there would be just enough to go woth just a few dollars extra. My friends do the same thing ad me but they bring just enough cash for a tip and paying for it. I also hate borrowing money from friends. 

Anyway. I was 4 bucks short and had to go for a smaller time limit with the cash I have. I got to spend less time than I wanted to with them because they were busy the rest of the time they were there. I didn't want them to go for the same time as me so even though they insisted, I told then to enjoy themselves. 

I was pissed so I left a very descriptive review with a time stamp and description of the person. Job competition is pretty stiff around here so odds are, she could be fired. My burger was dry too and she had a very ""I don't care"" vibe. 

AITA for leaving a poor review in hopes to getting her fired?","Leaving a review with the intent of getting someone fired, especially over a relatively small financial issue and poor service, can be viewed as an overreaction. It's understandable to be frustrated when service is poor, and it's perfectly valid to leave feedback about a negative experience. However, hoping that someone loses their job as a result is quite harsh, particularly if this was the first incident with that cashier.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Intentions**: Your intention behind leaving the review was to get the cashier fired, which might suggest vindictiveness rather than simply providing feedback for the business to improve. If this was an isolated incident, it might not warrant such severe consequences for the employee.

2. **Resolution**: The situation could potentially have been resolved by speaking directly to a manager at the time or revisiting the store later to address the issue. Most businesses are willing to correct mistakes if given the chance.

3. **Impact**: While the cashier's behavior and the mistake impacted your day, consider the overall impact your review could have on their livelihood. People make mistakes, and it's possible there were extenuating circumstances that day.

4. **Feedback**: Negative reviews can be helpful for a business when they point out areas for improvement, but focusing purely on punitive measures may not contribute constructively to the business or its employees.

Ultimately, whether or not you're an ""asshole"" is subjective and depends on one's personal values and how one feels about accountability versus empathy in customer service situations. ","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.1, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.2, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.1,-0.167,-0.2,-0.1

Okay. So earlier today my friend and I were planning to hang out. This past week I have been on my monthly time and without going into details, it makes me very sick and exhausted every time. I also keep my phone on silent because the buzzing of the notifications gives me anxiety.

I think I'm jealous. I've always felt that I want to be more social, but I can't. I never can get words to leave my mouth and it's difficult for me to be calm in social situations. I've missed out on so many opportunities because of this. My friends always claim that I have social anxiety. My family just teases me and says to ""Stop being chicken"", ""Don't be shy,"" and the most common, ""Man up."" I try, I really do. I want to talk to people but I really can't, it's hard. It makes me cry because I can't do anything without help. I've been struggling with this for so long. Everyone in my family knows about my social struggles, and I've tried asking them if I can get help. Their answer is always No. 
But the other day, my sister got overwhelmed and that sparked a mini anxiety attack. It wasnt extreme thankfully, but now my whole family is catering to her. Constantly making sure shes relaxed, calm and giving her time to recover. Even offering to pay for therapy for her. Something that I've yearned for, for forever. I know I should be happy that she's getting support, but I can't help but feel a little jealous because she's getting what I've always wanted and asked for.

It's completely normal to feel upset when you've been seeking help for a long time and it's not being offered to you, while someone else in a similar situation is receiving it.

Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Open Communication**: Find a quiet moment to talk to your family about how you feel. Use ""I"" statements to express your emotions, such as ""I feel hurt that I haven't been offered the same support as my sister.""

2. **Explain Your Situation**: Remind them of your struggles and how you've been asking for help. Make sure they understand that your sister's situation is not unique to her.

3. **Be Specific**: Ask for what you need. Instead of just saying ""I need help,"" say ""I need to see a therapist to work on my social anxiety.""

4. **Educate Them**: Help them understand that social anxiety is a real issue and that therapy could be beneficial for you.

5. **Seek Support**: If your family is still not supportive, consider seeking help from other avenues, such as school counselors, or even a trusted friend or mentor who might be able to advocate for you.

6. **Practice Self-Care**: Remember that it's okay to feel jealous, but try not to let it consume you. Focus on your own well-being and what you can do to improve your situation.

This is my first time posting here and English is not my native language so I apologize beforehand. Also I am bit stressed out by all this so I could be rambling a bit.

Some background info. Last September I started teaching at a vocational school and so far I have really enjoyed it. I am a woman in my late twenties and my students are 16-20 years old. When I first started working here I was warned that the previous teacher had been asked to leave due to some inappropriate behavior. There had been several incidents,  but one of them had been her telling a male student (currently 19 or 20) that she had developed strong feelings towards him and thus could not teach him anymore. I am now teaching this student and have been extra careful not to bee to friendly with him as I thought maybe he had been traumatized by the whole ordeal. However, I had accepted friend request from this student on FB as he had approached me previously with questions regarding international studies and I thought he might have some further questions. I should probably emphasize that I do not find any of my students to be sexually attractive as the age gap is too big and I cannot help myself but view them as children.

Fast forward to last weekend. It was around midnight and I was watching a movie with my partner when I suddenly receive a FB message from him consisting of simply a heart. He removed the message immediately, but I did manage to see it (my partner as well which led to an interesting conversation). Considering he had removed the message we assumed that it could have been a weird mistake or his friends were messing with him and the poor guy was probably cringing now. Then some 10 minutes later he sends a string of hearts which made me extremely uncomfortable. I immediately unfriended and blocked him. I have discussed this with my partner and best friend and both of them have suggested that maybe the whole former teacher drama had not been one sided and maybe I should go to the school administration (I have good relations with one of the principal's assistants) and show them the screenshot and explain the situation in order to cover my bases. The screenshot shows that I have blocked him and that he was the first messaging me as above his first removed message there is a text 'Say hi to your new FB friend!' I really do not want to do that; however, I am having a class with the student tomorrow and I am feeling really uncomfortable. Furthermore, I am starting to fear that somehow I could be made a predator in this whole situation which could effectively ruin my career. So WIBT if I took precautions and reported him first? He is graduating in May, but I just do not want to live in fear of him trying to somehow turn this situation.","You would not be the bad person (WIBTA) for reporting this incident to the school administration. In fact, it's a responsible and proactive step to take, considering the previous teacher's experience and the student's behavior towards you.

Given the circumstances, it's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable and concerned about your professional reputation. Reporting the incident can help you:

1. **Document the incident**: By sharing the screenshot and explaining the situation, you'll have a record of what happened, which can help protect you from potential false accusations.
2. **Protect yourself**: If the student were to make any false claims or try to escalate the situation, having reported the incident can help demonstrate that you took reasonable steps to address the issue.
3. **Ensure a safe learning environment**: Informing the administration can help them take necessary steps to ensure the student's behavior doesn't create a hostile or uncomfortable environment for you or other students.

When reporting the incident, be sure to:

1. **Stay calm and objective**: Explain the situation factually, without making assumptions or accusations.
2. **Focus on your concerns**: Emphasize your concerns about your professional reputation, the potential impact on your teaching, and the need to maintain a safe and respectful learning environment.
3. **Provide evidence**: Share the screenshot and any other relevant information that supports your account of the incident.

Remember, you have the right to work in a safe and respectful environment, and reporting this incident is a reasonable step to take to protect yourself and your career.

As for your concerns about being seen as a ""predator,"" it's essential to remember that you've done nothing wrong. You've maintained professional boundaries, and the student's behavior is the issue, not yours.

My 17 year old sister is the most stunning and smart girl I've ever met, I honestly have nothing but esteem for her. She's smart, she's funny, and she's got the greatest heart I've ever seen in a human. She loves the bully and the victim. She doesn't lack in confidence or male/female attention, and right now she has a male companion. I'm her 15 year old younger brother. If I'm allowed to exercise my ego for a moment I don't believe I'm bad-looking and I've got many friends, I have success in many areas of sport and study, and I have a steady girlfriend who I adore. In short, I'm not jealous of my sister.

Our house has a kind of weird layout and means my sister has the third floor bedroom, plenty of privacy, however there's a half floor landing between the second and third floor that houses her and mine shared bathroom that looks into my sister's bedroom, however because of the angle you can't really see the person the bathroom landing. A few months ago I went up for a midnight pee and her bedroom door was open and she was awake. I typically glance inside to check on her and on this night I saw her laying on her bed making out with her teddy bear. She's had this bear since she was three and she routinely patches his increasingly multiple age spots and has a pathological fear of getting rid of him.

She's possessive of him and our mom likes to tease her cruel and hide the bear and tell her she threw it away. My sister always gets incredibly upset and cries, leading me to take the bear from mom and give it back. I've asked mom to stop hiding the damn bear multiple times but she thinks it's funny and harmless, constantly asking my sister what's gonna happen when she goes to college next fall and has a roommate who makes fun of her for having a teddy bear at 18.

Anyway, I've gone up to use the bathroom at various points during the day and night over the last few months and I've seen her kissing her teddy bear several times. It's really starting to concern me. She has a boyfriend, one might think she'd rather kiss him. I don't think this is weird or degenerate but I'm worried about her, I don't know what this means. So  day before yesterday I waited until my sister had gone to bed and so had mom and I talked to my dad about it. Next thing I know he woke mom up and they were in sister's room screaming at her and calling all sorts of mean names. Mom took the bear and threw him away. Away away. That bear is never coming back. And my sister is absolutely despondent. She came into my room the night it happened, tearful and asked me why I told them. I tried to explain that I was concerned for her but I think she was too upset to have a conversation so all she did was a sort of hiccup/sob and went back to her room.

And now she won't come out and I feel like shit. AITA?

ETA: Yeah, I know my mom is awful. She knows she's awful.","The eternal conundrum of sibling dynamics! I'm here to help you work through this.

Firstly, let me acknowledge that your concern for your sister's well-being is genuine, and it's great that you're thinking about her emotional health. However, I do think you could have approached the situation differently.

Telling your parents about your sister's behavior without her knowledge or consent was a breach of trust, and it's understandable that she feels hurt and betrayed. Your parents' overreaction, which included taking away the teddy bear, was likely exacerbated by your initial reveal.

It's essential to consider your sister's feelings and boundaries in this situation. You mentioned that she has a boyfriend, and it's possible that she's using the teddy bear as a coping mechanism or a way to express herself in a way that's not related to her romantic relationship. Perhaps she's not even aware of the extent to which she's ""making out"" with the teddy bear, or maybe it's a way for her to process her emotions.

Before involving your parents, you could have had a conversation with your sister about your concerns. You could have approached her when she was in a calm state, explained your worries, and asked her how she felt about the situation. This would have allowed her to process her emotions and respond in a way that was safe and respectful.

Now that the situation has escalated, it's crucial that you work to repair your relationship with your sister. You could start by apologizing to her for betraying her trust and for not respecting her boundaries. You might also consider having a conversation with your parents about their reaction and how it affected your sister.

Remember, your sister's well-being is important, but so is her autonomy and right to make her own decisions about her relationships and behaviors. As her brother, it's essential to support her and respect her boundaries, even if you don't fully understand her actions.

So, AITA? Well, I think you could have handled the situation better, but I also acknowledge that your intentions were good. Try to make amends with your sister, and work on being more considerate and empathetic in the future.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.4, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.4,0.133,0.0,0.4

Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.

We had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.

My sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.

...except, she wasn't accepted.

> Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.

> During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both ""recently applied"" and other who had been ""accepted"" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error.

1. **Privacy**: The emails were between your sister and the coach. Even though you're her sibling, it's important to respect her privacy and involve her in decisions about sharing her personal communications.

2. **Potential Consequences**: Publicizing the emails could have unintended consequences. The coach or the university could potentially face disciplinary action, which might not be what your sister wants. Additionally, it could lead to backlash against your sister from the university community.

3. **Biased Perspective**: The swimmers who are criticizing you might not fully understand the emotional toll this has taken on your sister. However, their perspective is still valid, and it's important to consider that your actions might have affected them negatively as well.

4. **Aim of Publicizing**: If your goal was to raise awareness about the college admissions process and the potential for mistakes, there might be other ways to do so without publicly shaming the coach or the university.

It's understandable that you and your family are upset, and it's important to support your sister through this difficult time. However, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation with her about how she feels about the situation and what she wants to do moving forward.

I had a massive stomach ache and I shouldn’t have gone out at all but I wanted the chance to maybe kiss Tristan so I went anyways. We walked into the park across the street from the mall and as soon as we sat down on the swings I farted so loud. Tristan went from being really nice to a total jerk and said he was afraid of being in the park and was afraid of his parents getting him in trouble for sneaking off. It had been his idea in the first place. When we got back he just went with the boys and ignored me. He didn’t call me an asshole but I sure feel like one. I cried to my mom and my mom told my dad even though she knew he would make fun of me. And now my brother is torturing me. I feel
Like such an asshole am I one?","NTA.  You're 15 and you had a stomach ache.  Accidentally farting is a completely normal bodily function.  It's embarrassing, yes, but it's not something you should beat yourself up over, especially not to the extent you are.

Tristan's reaction is immature and frankly, unkind.  He's the one who suggested sneaking off, and his response to a completely natural occurrence is ridiculous. He's shown himself to be more interested in avoiding potential consequences than in being a decent human being.  Don't let his behavior define your self-worth.

Your family is being incredibly insensitive.  While it's understandable that they might find the situation humorous (though their teasing is over the line), they should be supporting you, not making fun of you.  Talk to your mom again, and let her know how much their teasing is hurting you.  Maybe she can help them understand that this wasn't a deliberate action on your part and that you need their empathy, not their mockery.

Focus on taking care of yourself.  This is a minor incident that doesn't reflect your value as a person. Don't let Tristan's immaturity or your family's teasing ruin your self-esteem. You deserve better.

My baby brother married a woman a few years ago who we loved at first (We’ll call her L). But over the years, her dislike/disapproval of us keeps showing. She belittles us and talks incredibly disrespectful to my mom. We can’t even buy her a gift without her having a smart-ass attitude about it. The only time my brother talks to any of us, is when he’s in the car by himself, it’s like he doesn’t want L to know he’s talking to us. L also always seems mad about the fact that my brother is the youngest, we all adore him & love him to pieces. When we do see them maybe twice a year, she’s constantly looking at my brother to roll her eyes or smirk about whatever we say & she’s only stay a very short time. We do joke around/tease one another, but that’s just how we deal with things. My brother used to be the same way. I know part of why they look down on us is because they both have great jobs and are considered upper class while the rest of us are working/middle class. They believe they’re better than us and it shows. They even disinvited us to their summer boat party one hour before the party started, claiming “there wouldn’t be room for us”. Even though we were invited before EVERYONE else. They have get togethers, baby showers, parties, etc and we’re never invited. It’s so hurtful, my moms always crying and while my sister and I are hurt, we’re mostly angry. Here’s the final straw, they’re having a baby soon. (I can’t have children if my own & my relationships with my nieces & nephews means the world to me. I treat them amazing & love spending time with them). L recently sent a text stating none of us will be allowed to see the baby until we get 2 vaccines that cost about $300 per person (which I’m actually ok with, I don’t want to do anything to hurt my nephew). Buy my sister has an autistic toddler who isn’t due for these shots yet so she can’t see the baby at all. We’re also not allowed to hug or kiss the baby, we may hold the baby shortly but only if I wear fresh laundered clothing & have taken a fresh shower (bc I’m an occasional smoker), also the baby is never allowed at my house (I don’t understand why, I don’t smoke in my house) There were many other stipulations included and I agree some are reasonable but are basic common sense. Our family feels like this list of demands is really her way of making it near impossible for any of us to be around the baby & unable to bond with him. I’m Devastated but I’m not willing to jump threw L’s constantly changing hoops just to see the baby. AITA for not wanting to follow these ridiculously crazy rules, even if that means not seeing my nephew?","It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and frustrated by the situation with your brother and his wife, L. It sounds like there have been ongoing tensions and that their approach to family interactions has been difficult for you and your family to manage. The protective measures for their baby may feel excessive to you, but it’s important to remember that new parents often have heightened concerns about their newborn’s health, especially during the early months.

L's rules might seem strict, but some of them (like vaccination requirements) are based on valid health concerns. However, it's also valid to feel like these rules are a means of keeping a distance from the family, especially given the history of strained relations and exclusion from events.

Given the complexity of the situation, it's important to focus on communication. Could you have a calm and open conversation with your brother? Express your feelings without accusations. It might help to understand the motivations behind the rules and see if there's any room for compromise. Just remember, the baby’s health and parental comfort come first, but your feelings are also valid, and open communication could be the first step towards mending the relationship.

Ultimately, standing firm in your decision not to see the baby under these conditions doesn't necessarily make you an ""asshole""; it means you are setting boundaries that feel right for you. But it could be beneficial to explore if there's a middle ground where your concerns and theirs can be addressed.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.4, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.6000000000000001,-0.133,-0.4,0.2

It's understandable that you may feel annoyed by his sudden interest in communication, especially during a family visit. You can provide updates when asked but don't feel obligated to engage in lengthy conversations or ""quick chats"" that may feel like lectures.

You're not an asshole for wanting to set boundaries in your relationships, especially when those boundaries have been consistently respected by the other party in the past. However, it might be a good idea to consider the feelings of your wife and her family, as they may view your lack of interest in communicating with your brother-in-law as cold or dismissive. Open communication with your wife about your feelings and expectations could help alleviate any potential misunderstandings or hurt feelings.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.133,0.0,0.2

She's a year younger than me & I knew immediately that it was a bad idea. Her boyfriend was a jerk & they fought constantly. A couple months after my nephew is born, my sister gets pregnant AGAIN.

Now I'm full-on panic mode because I know my drug/alcohol addicted sister & her BF could barely handle one baby, let alone two. But my mom is excited to be a Gma & got everything set up for my sister. Cribs, diapers, clothes, toys, you name it, my mom either bought it or got donations.

Now, something to know about me, I hate kids & it's only gotten worse over time.

Lots of drama later, I'm skipping a good 2 years here or this would be pages longer, my sister has been kicked out of our house & my mom ends up taking in my niece & nephew because my sister was neglecting them. They're 1 & 2 at this point, and my disabled mother is spending all her waking (and sleeping) hours to take care of them & get them set up in foster care so we can at least have financial support for them. Oh yeah, and I'm working full time to support two extra mouths. They've been here for 6-7 months when my mom promised at the time they'd only be staying for the weekend...  even at the time I had flat-out refused to let them stay.

But my mom can't turn away her grandchildren & she doesn't trust their father not to take them to Mexico to spite my sister. She loves them to no end & doesn't want them to end up in the foster care system. I can understand her reasoning, and see it from her perspective, but I only wish she'd never gotten attached to them, listened to my concerns before they were born. But what do I know.

Every day it's noise, messes, my house is an absolute disaster & I'm working 40+ hours a week while trying to get my business off the ground in my few hours of free time every day & trying to save up enough to move out of this personal nightmare. My mom's health has declined dramatically (it wasn't stellar to begin with) and I'm constantly worried this stress is taking years off her life. Not only that, the CPS system her is a fricking joke. Not once have I been talked to in private about this situation & my concerns.

My mom thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to live with emotionally traumatized, loud, messy toddlers & is constantly guilt tripping me for trying to save up enough to move out. I've fought too hard to overcome my clinical depression to get stuck in this situation. 

I'm taking promotions & working overtime in this job that I don't care about just to save up enough money to leave, but since I'm the breadwinner of the household, my mom's constantly reminding me that she'll lose the house & won't be able to support herself when I'm gone. But I don't care, she chose those kids over her own daughter & she knows full well what living here does to me. I rarely leave my room when I'm at home, I've gained weight, & my depression is starting to return.

AITA here?","No, you are not the asshole in this situation. Your sister made a series of poor choices that have led to this chaos, and your mom is trying to help out despite her own health issues. However, your mom's decision to take in the children without consulting you and without considering your own well-being is problematic.

It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the situation. You're working long hours, trying to save up to move out, and dealing with the constant noise, mess, and chaos caused by the toddlers. You're also worried about your mom's health and the impact this situation is having on her.

Your mom's guilt trips and accusations of selfishness are unfair and unhelpful. You're not being selfish by wanting to leave the situation and prioritize your own well-being. In fact, you're being responsible and proactive in trying to find a solution that works for everyone involved.

It's also important to recognize that you're not alone in this situation. Many people would struggle to cope with the demands of caring for two young children, especially when they're not your own. You're doing the best you can under difficult circumstances, and that's something to be proud of.

If I were you, I would consider having an open and honest conversation with your mom about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact this situation is having on you, and a calm and respectful conversation could help her understand your perspective. You might also consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you cope with the stress and anxiety you're feeling.

Remember, you don't have to be a martyr or sacrifice your own well-being to care for others. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take steps to create a more sustainable and fulfilling life for yourself.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.4,0.267,0.0,0.4

He's openly okay with being the ""2nd string tech"" aka the guy who handles tier 1 desktop issues exclusively (monitor wont' turn on, PC won't connect to the internet..simple shit like that). Now normally, that wouldn't be an issue if there were other people to assist with our tasks but that, unfortunately, is not the case. 

We get ticket requests sent to our e-mail whenever an employee submits a ticket. We both get these communications but he never responds to them or sees them...he just browses facebook for ""sweet deals on DJ equipment bro"". And that's what grinds me. I'm currently responsible for:

1. Our entire office inventory, both in stock and in use
2. A backlog of windows updates that needed to be deployed like...last year
3. And our regular day to day operations. 

1 & 2 are simple enough but not when I have to make sure that tickets are being accepted and resolved (7/10 by me).

We don’t have a perfect history but we’ve gotten pretty close as she’s gotten older. I have never treated his girls as anything other than my daughters. I honestly thought we were fine. 
She has a bunch of cousins that gave her tons of baby stuff and she has just asked for diapers and wipes from my family. Of course my sister and I want to get her all kinds of gifts, but we kid her about it. I wanted to give her a shower, but she wasn’t really interested in anything but a luncheon, so we said we’d do that and ask everyone to help put together her baby book in lieu of gifts. I keep mentioning that she’s likely to have the baby early because of her contractions, having a small torso and a very large baby, etc, but it’s mostly in fun.
So recently my husband and I have been talking about our grandparent names. I wanted to go with Emmy and he just wasn’t happy with super traditional ones, but didn’t know what he wanted otherwise. Stepdaughter is putting her foot down that she would NOT call me that and that she wants to call us Grandpa and my first name. When they were little their mom insisted I be called by my name even when stepdad was called dad. It hurt me to my core to think she wouldn’t allow me to have a grandparent name. Then she suggested MiMi and when I said I didn’t like it, she complained that I was steamrolling her on EVERYTHING about the baby including how to raise it?!? 
I feel like she’s being incredibly ungrateful, especially since she is now angry and calling off the luncheon we had planned for her. 
I don’t really want to compromise on this but I don’t know what to do. I realize she’s probably hormonal and overwhelmed, but this seems like something that barely affects her but means a lot to me.","It sounds like a challenging situation, and it's understandable that you feel strongly about having a grandparent name for your step-grandchild. However, it's also important to consider your step-daughter's feelings in this matter, especially given your history and the current circumstances.

It seems that she might be feeling overwhelmed and insecure about the upcoming changes in her life, and the grandparent name might be a small thing she can assert control over. It's possible that she's reacting hormonally, as you suggested, or it could be a deeper issue.

Given the current tension, it might be beneficial to take a step back and revisit the conversation at a later time when emotions are less heightened. You could express your feelings about the name in a calm and respectful manner, explaining why it's important to you. At the same time, you could also listen to her concerns and try to find a compromise that respects both your feelings and her wishes.

It's also worth considering whether the name issue is a symptom of larger issues in your relationship. If this is a pattern of behavior from your step-daughter, it might be helpful to seek counseling to help improve communication and understanding between you.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that this is a joyous time for your family, and it's crucial to find a way to navigate this issue in a way that maintains harmony and respect for everyone involved.

At the outset I promised myself that I would get romantically involved with or sleep with any of them so as to not make the living situation awkward or complicated. A few months in, once I got to know them better, I began to get very close to one of them. Everything about her behavior seemed flirtatious: long, warm hugs, her willingness to be open and share, her desire to talk about sex, how she smiled, looked at and touched me. It all seemed like flirting which, against my better judgment, I fell for. 

I began to get attached to her emotionally and we started doing more things together. I thought for sure this would at least lead to sex, if not a relationship. I took it slowly. I wanted to make the right moves at the right time. Then my older came to stay for two nights. 

I know my brother. I honestly was very reluctant to let him stay with me because I was afraid he would sleep with my roommate. But he’s my brother, so what am I to do?  Surely he has respect for my place and my boundaries. I worked from 3 to 11 both nights of his stay, so I left keys for him to get into my apartment. I figured we could hang out after I got free. 

I came home and waited until 1:30am for him. I thought he might be out with my roommate, but I figured they would send me an invite. It never came. Just as I was about to go to bed I heard a door open, so I went to investigate. My roommates door was ajar and both had exited. 

I didn’t want to believe it. The next morning I asked him directly if he had slept with her. He said no. I was so desperate to believe him I left it at that and told him how I felt about her. We had a late lunch then I left for work. He went back to my apartment. 

I couldn’t escape the thought that he had lied to me, so a few days after he left I asked my roommate, while we were cuddling, if she had slept with him. She said “of course not”.  

For a month my roommate and I got closer. We cuddled, talked intimately, occasionally did some heavy petting, but she wouldn’t sleep with me and wouldn’t say why. But her flirting continued. I would tell my brother my frustrations and joys about her until finally, at the end of the month, he came clean and told me the truth.  They did sleep together. Both nights. 

I can maybe understand the first night: he didn’t know how I felt. But I told him the second day and he did it again anyway that night. And as for her, she claims she never intentionally flirted with me; that’s just “how she is”.  They both lied to me for a month and I feel deeply hurt and betrayed by both of them and my trust in my brother is shattered.  What’s worse is that I really wanted my roommate to like me more than a friend. She never did. Yet in two nights she fell in love with my brother. And that honestly feels like I was robbed of something.  I later got the chance to read their text history. It was as flirty as you can imagine. They had every intention of meeting again. And they frequently called each other. She had never called me once. 

Am I the asshole here? I get I am in a way punishing them for my delusion: my roommate and I were never anything but roommates, but she really lead me on and I feel fostered my emotional attachment to her.  Is my anger and heartache justified, or am I being crazy?","It's understandable that you feel hurt, betrayed, and angry in this situation. Your roommate and your brother both lied to you and acted in ways that violated your trust and feelings. It's important to acknowledge that your roommate may have unintentionally led you on, but it's also crucial to take responsibility for your own feelings and actions.

It's essential to communicate your feelings to both of them and set clear boundaries moving forward.

I like to take pictures while we’re there because my son’s father and I aren’t together so he likes when I can send pictures of our son playing and doing stuff; I also take pics for my boyfriend as he works away so he also likes to have me send him pics of what me and the kids do.

1. **Public Space**: You were in a public space, and you have the right to take pictures of your own children in such a setting.
2. **No Rules**: You mentioned there are no rules against taking pictures in the playgroup, so you're not violating any stated guidelines.
3. **Background**: Other children appearing in the background of your photos is incidental, and it's not your responsibility to ensure they are not included.
4. **Communication**: The other mother could have politely asked you not to post pictures that include her child, but she didn't have the right to tell you not to post pictures of your own child.

However, it's always a good idea to be considerate of others' feelings and concerns about their children's privacy and safety. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Cropping**: You can crop the photos to exclude other children if you plan to post them on social media.
2. **Communication**: If someone expresses concern, it's polite to listen and accommodate their request if possible.
3. **Respect**: Even though you're not required to, respecting the wishes of other parents can help maintain a positive environment in the playgroup.

Some background: my parents are well off. My mother is an exec and has been making close to half a million dollars a year. I was lucky enough to graduate from college with no debt in part because they were able to pay the remainder after a generous scholarship + my graduating early. Then I worked for a few years, off of their payroll, but they’ve always been generous with gifts. For example, they’ve still invited me and my brother (22M) on family vacations and they helped me with a down payment on my first apartment.

I'm in my second year at law school, and at the onset my mother generously offered to cover whatever I couldn’t. Well, it turns out law school was a good investment in this case—I’m at the top of my class, and landed a summer associateship next year at one of the top firms in the country. The pay from that summer will fully cover my last year’s tuition, and these kinds of internships often result in an offer at market rate after graduation.

Our family is close, and I’ve always told my mother that I would be happy to do for her + my dad in retirement what she did for me + my brother if I could afford it. But she’s also planned very well for retirement, so there’s never been any expectation that they couldn’t cover their own bills.

Well, out of the blue today while we were on the phone my mom told me that she thinks I should cover the “family” cell account when I’ve graduated. The plan would include parents, my brother (graduating from a prestigious college with an engineering degree this year), and me. I expressed confusion because I figured me + bro would be splitting off after graduation. She kept pushing and making excuses about how it would be “cheaper” to all be together (but it definitely wouldn’t be cheaper for me to cover a $400 plan). I wouldn’t fold. I reiterated to her that I would be trying to restore my savings account and budgeting once I started working since I will have depleted my savings completely and basically earned negative income for three years. Then she started pulling out all of the things she’s paid for in the past and asking when I would pay her back for those, if I wouldn’t “even” cover their phone bill. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t try to cover them if they were in actual financial danger (I told her that), but I don’t want her or anyone else to be planning to spend a salary that I’m not even making yet literally over a year in advance. 

But she sounded so legitimately hurt, like I was just throwing her and my father to the wolves and being ungrateful for what they’ve done for me. I know my life has been MONUMENTALLY easier because of their help. But I’ve been taught to make good financial choices, and it seems like a really dumb one to promise to spend money that I don’t have on someone who makes more than 99% of the country. 

AITA? Should I have just agreed to help?

EDIT: Trying to stay under 3000 characters made this more confusing. First: I haven't lived in the family home since I was 21. I paid my own bills from 21-25. Second: Mother's original arrangement was to put me on family payroll while I'm in law school but deplete my savings + let me contribute as much as possible with summer jobs, then come back off the phone plan (and all of the ""shared"" family accounts) and pay for myself completely once I graduate.","NTA.  Your mother is being unreasonable.  She's wealthy, you've already benefited greatly from her generosity, and you're about to enter a high-paying career.  However, that doesn't obligate you to subsidize her phone bill, especially when she hasn't presented a real financial need.  

Her guilt-tripping and bringing up past expenses is manipulative.  You've been responsible with your finances, and continuing to be fiscally responsible as you launch your career is a smart move.  Sticking to your plan to rebuild your savings is perfectly reasonable.  There's a big difference between being grateful for past help and being financially obligated to your parents indefinitely.

119,0.367,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"WIBTA for cutting off a long time friend for his benzodiazepine addiction? A friend of mine from high school is without question, addicted to benzodiazepines (Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin, Valium). Hes currently prescribed a very high dose of Klonopin for his anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and has been on it for at least 5 years

We kind of grew distant in the past year or so, but he reached out to me a few months ago. We agreed to hang out, and had a nice conversation about life and recovery (I'm an ex heroin addict and have been clean for over a year). He told me about his problems about his wife separating from him, problems with his family etc. I left feeling pretty hopeful we had a meaningful conversation, and had alot in common. We were in agreement he needs to get off the benzos and he said he was going to make a sincere effort to get off them and better his life.

I'm currently prescribed a low dose of klonopin ( which I havent taken in over 6 months, I just like knowing I have them if I ever need them). He found out about it and hes been messaging me every few weeks to try and buy them. He says hes in withdrawal and theres always some excuse to why he needs more. I know the withdrawal can be hell, so I caved in and would come through every month (for the past 4 months) to give him my bottle.

I know addiction is hell, and I honestly do feel bad for him, and I like him as a person. But I cant shake the feeling hes really not making an effort to better his life. He always flatters me with complements and jokes, and tells me how I'm such a good friend and really helping him out when I see him. I want to believe it, but part of me feels like all he really gives a shit about is the pills. Hes called and texted me about 10 times today from private numbers, saying stuff like ""did I do something wrong:(?"" Because I didnt text him when I got them refilled this month.

I've been ignoring his calls for 2 days now, he sounds really desperate for pills, and I cant tell if hes manipulating me whenever I see him, or if hes genuinely my friend down and down his luck. I really wish I could help him find that strength inside him to ditch these pills and move on. But I'm not sure if it's ever going to happen.

WIBTA if I cut this friend out of my life?

Edit: My friend comes from a wealthy family, he has been in rehab before, and believe me I've tried to convince him to get real help.

My question isn't if I'm TA for giving him the pills, my question is WIBTA for cutting him off/abandoning him","What a complex and difficult situation.

While it's understandable that you want to help your friend, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries. Enabling someone's addiction can be detrimental to both parties.

Cutting off your friend might be a tough decision, but it could be a necessary one. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Your friend's behavior is not healthy**: Despite your efforts to help, he's continued to ask for pills, and his actions suggest that he's more focused on getting his fix than genuinely improving his life.
2. **You're being manipulated**: The fact that he's calling and texting you repeatedly, using guilt trips and flattery, indicates that he might be using you for his own gain.
3. **You've tried to help, but it's not working**: You've offered support, and he's acknowledged his problems, but he hasn't made significant progress in getting off the benzos or improving his life.
4. **Your own recovery is important**: As someone who's overcome addiction, you need to prioritize your own recovery and avoid situations that might trigger or stress you out.

Cutting off your friend doesn't mean abandoning him; it means setting boundaries and taking care of yourself. It's possible that he'll hit rock bottom and seek help when he's ready. Until then, you can't force him to change.

Consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend, explaining your concerns and boundaries. Let him know that you're willing to support him in seeking professional help, but you can't continue to enable his addiction.

If he continues to exhibit unhealthy behavior, it might be time to distance yourself or establish a boundary, such as not providing him with pills or limiting your interactions.

Ultimately, the decision is yours. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being.

**WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) for cutting off your friend?** No, you wouldn't be the asshole. You'd be taking care of yourself and setting necessary boundaries to protect your own recovery and well-being.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.7, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.7,0.367,0.0,0.7
120,-0.067,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for throwing out a dish that my mom specifically made for me? I live pretty close to my parents, not by choice. I’m of Indian origin and as anyone with brown parents will tell you, it’s pretty hard to do your own thing and maintain family ties at the same time... I love them, but they wouldn’t hear of me moving away and out of respect I stayed close by. Even that they didn’t want me moving out and buying my own place but tbh I’d go nuts if I lived with my parents. 

Background on me- I’m trying to slowly get on the dating scene after being a socially awkward pudgy loner for most of my 20’s. I wasn’t allowed a social life with my Hindu ex pat parents and when I hit 29, I decided enough was enough and started to go to the gym, and frankly I’ve never felt better and my confidence is at an all time high. I’m 32 now and look okay, but I have a real problem with food so I need to be strict to keep my cravings at bay. It’s a work in progress.

My Indian mom insists on sending me home cooked foods laden with ghee and fried onion and yoghurt, with homemade rotis (bread) so basically none of this is okay for my diet. She doesn’t believe in dieting and tells me lovingly that I need to fatten up. Part of moving out was me respecting my own boundaries because Asian parents just don’t listen. 

Because Christmas is huge in our household my mom sent my younger bro over to my place with fried bhajias (kind of like spiced onion and potato deep fried in batter) despite me telling her on the phone I didn’t want them. 

She sent them anyway. 

Now it’s one of my favorite foods so temptation is very strong to eat them. When they got to my home they were still hot and the paper towels were stained with grease... delicious. However I knew I couldn’t just have one, I would eat all of them so I threw them straight in the trash. I would ask my neighbors if they want them but I know that 1 neighbor is GF and 1 neighbor can’t handle spicy food so sadly they went in the bin. 

Now a couple hours later my mom came to my place because she wanted to use my fridge to store extra Xmas food, we have like 100 fam members coming to her place on Xmas and since I’m nearby she wants to use my fridge space. She went to throw out some old crap I had in the fridge and she saw the paper plate in the trash. 

She legit started crying calling me ungrateful and that I have no appreciation, etc. I told her that I refused them on the phone and she still sent them over so what am I meant to do. I’m kinda frustrated because I was an overweight kid my entire life and an overweight teen too, because I didn’t get proper nutrition or food supervision and she doesn’t take me seriously when I said I don’t want something","In this situation, it seems like there's a misunderstanding between you and your mother, and it's important to communicate your feelings and needs clearly. You've made it clear that certain foods are not suitable for your diet, and it's understandable that you would feel frustrated when those foods are sent to you despite your explicit requests.

However, it's also important to consider your mother's perspective. She might be coming from a place of love and concern, wanting to ensure you're well-fed and happy. It's possible that she doesn't fully understand the impact of certain foods on your diet or the emotional struggle you've gone through to maintain your current lifestyle.

In the future, you might want to have a conversation with your mother about your dietary needs and preferences. Explain to her why certain foods are off-limits for you and how her support in maintaining your diet is crucial for your health and well-being. It's also important to express your gratitude for her efforts and let her know that you appreciate her concern, even if you can't eat the food she sends.

In this specific instance, it might be helpful to apologize for any hurt feelings and explain that you threw out the bhajias because you knew you wouldn't be able to resist them and would end up eating them all. Offer to make it up to her by cooking a meal for her or buying her a small gift as a token of your appreciation.

Ultimately, it's important to find a balance between respecting your own boundaries and maintaining a strong relationship with your family. Open and honest communication is key in this process.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.067,-0.2,0.0
121,-0.267,calculated,R: NTA AI: YTA,"AITA for getting McDonald’s drive through while my boyfriend was fasting for surgery? My boyfriend was scheduled to have his wisdom teeth removed at 12pm, and he had to fast from 6am that morning. He got up at 5.30am to have breakfast, whereas I slept in until 10am, got up to have a coffee and a shower, and we were in the car at 11.30am to head to the hospital. As we headed off, I realised that not only was I hungry, but I was probably going to have to wait around with him before he went in for his surgery so I wouldn’t have any time to get food once we arrived (ended up waiting 3 hours with him). So as we went past a maccas, I told him I was hungry and could I quickly grab an egg McMuffin in the drive through, and he said yes. As we drove off and I started to eat it, he wound down the windows a bit without saying anything but I didn’t take much notice. I then asked him a random question and he gave me a snarky response. I asked him what was wrong and he said it was inconsiderate of me to have complained about being hungry and then gotten food when he obviously would have been hungry and not allowed to eat, especially because it smelled so strong in the car. I asked him why he said yes to us going through the drive through and he said he’s not going to tell me I can’t eat. I asked him if he expected me to fast with him and he said no but I could have made the effort to get up earlier and eat while he was in the shower or another room so it wasn’t tempting for him. I do understand where he is coming from, however not enough for me to believe I am in the wrong. AITA?","The eternal conundrum of hunger, consideration, and drive-thru temptation!

While you did get food in front of your boyfriend, who was fasting for surgery, there are a few factors to consider:

1. **You didn't know he was fasting when you asked for food**: You mentioned you slept in and didn't know about his fasting schedule. You only realized you were hungry and thought you'd grab something quick.
2. **He said yes to the drive-thru**: Your boyfriend gave you permission to get food, which might have been a momentary lapse in judgment or a desire not to deprive you of food. This doesn't necessarily mean he was okay with it, but he did give you the green light.
3. **You weren't trying to tempt him**: You didn't intentionally try to make him crave food or tempt him with the smell. You were simply hungry and wanted something to eat.

However, it's also understandable that your boyfriend felt frustrated:

1. **The smell was strong**: The aroma of an Egg McMuffin can be overpowering, and it's reasonable that he might have felt triggered or frustrated by the smell.
2. **He felt like you weren't considerate**: He might have felt that you didn't take his fasting into account or consider how your actions might affect him.

In retrospect, it might have been thoughtful of you to offer to get him something to eat or drink that he could have had later, or to have waited until he was done fasting to get your food. However, you didn't know about his fasting schedule, and he did give you permission to get food.

Considering these factors, I'd say you're not entirely in the wrong (NTA). You were hungry, and you didn't intentionally try to make your boyfriend's fasting more difficult. However, it's also clear that you could have been more considerate of his situation. A simple ""Hey, I'm hungry, do you want me to get you something for later?"" or ""Should I wait until you're done fasting?"" might have avoided the issue.

Ultimately, communication is key in situations like this. You and your boyfriend can discuss what happened and how you can be more considerate of each other's needs in the future.","{""swaggamasta420"": -0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.4, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.267,-0.4,-0.2

Yes, you would be the asshole. It's important to communicate your feelings and set boundaries, but using disrespectful or harsh language is not the way to do it. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Disrespectful Language**: Telling someone to ""shut up"" is disrespectful and hurtful. It's important to use kind and considerate language, especially when speaking to family members and children.

2. **Setting a Bad Example**: As an adult, you should set a good example for younger family members. Using harsh language can model inappropriate behavior.

3. **It's Her Nature**: You mentioned that your niece is generally very loud. It might be her nature, and she might not be able to control it. Instead of telling her to shut up, you could try to understand her better and find a way to communicate effectively.

4. **It's Your Birthday**: While it's true that it's your special day, it's also important to remember that everyone has their own needs and preferences. Finding a way to enjoy your day without making others feel bad is key.

Instead of telling her to ""shut up,"" you could try communicating your feelings in a kind and considerate way.

123,0.167,manual,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for kicking a homeless guy off my porch in the snow Background: I'm an *extremely* paranoid person, and already had one dude break in while I was home a few years ago. I met that dude at the door with a gun, but it scared the crap out of me and made me pretty jumpy for years. I have cameras everywhere, and when I bought my house I specifically and **repeatedly** told my family I didn't want ANYONE outside of extremely close family to know where I lived. I did this, because my father is very nice and attracts clinger ons like nobodies business, and is constantly having to deal with druggy employees that are good people . . .just crazy ones that are homeless, car less, alcoholics that are constantly in and out of jail etc. I'm sure you know the type


Anyway, at about 1:15 A.M. today this dude shows up BLOWING up my doorbell, he rang it like 60 times in a minute and a half period. I saw him on the camera, and he had a little dog with him, so I assumed he was a neighbor or something thinking the dog was mine after finding a stray. 

Before I could get to the front door, he circled around the house and was at the back door. I grabbed a gun (kept  it concealed so he didn't know I had it) and met him at the back door to figure out WTF he was doing.  

It was some guy who worked for my father months and months ago, that I have only met ONCE. My father brought him by house one day for some stupid reason, so now the guy knows where I live. I was extremely leery when I met him the first time, he was pretty shifty, and of course, had to come in side for something and saw that I have big tv's everywhere and all kinds of fancy crap inside. 

He apparently *just got out of jail* today, and was walking across town to ""the house he's working on building"" to sleep, but there's snow on the ground so he was cold and wanted to ""warm up"" in my glassed in porch. I'm not heartless, despite already being EXTREMELY uncomfortable, so I said he could sit there for a bit and warm up, but he needed to head on. He was rambling some **serious** red flag raising nonsense about having to ""pawn some stuff for groceries"" and how everyone he knew robbed him and wronged him,  and how several including his own mother apparently pulled guns on him, and he reeked of alcohol as soon I opened the door. 


An hour and a half later I saw he still hadn't left, so I went out and he was out there watching TV using a space heater I kept out there. I told him again he was going to have to move on, and made him think my mother was in the house getting nervous about him being there and was going to call the cops. 

30 minutes later, I was about to go out and tell him to leave or I was calling the cops,  when I finally saw him leaving. This was at 3, so he was there almost 2 freaking hours. I live alone and don't want random homeless people showing up in the middle of the night. I feel bad for him and his puppy, but come on! This is precisely why I try so hard not to let anyone know where I live. Now I won't be able to sleep the rest of the night because I have to watch the cameras and make sure he's actually gone. I realized after I saw him, that he was the same guy I called the cops on a few months back, because I saw him on the cameras messing around in my yard. I went out last time too, to see who it was but he was already gone by the time I got outside, so I let the cops know a dude was acting funky in the neighborhood. That was already pretty weird, but after a few days I just assumed it was some vagrant passing through, or weird funky salesman or something. 

I feel terrible that I had to make him leave in the cold on a day with snow everywhere, AITA here? I feel like Scrooge. If it had been someone I knew like a friend or something, I would have let them sleep on the couch inside, or if it had even been some of my father's employees that I at least *know* I would have let them sleep in the glassed in porch with the heater. But he just raised *so* many red flags.","NTA (Not The Asshole). Given your past experiences and concerns about safety, it's understandable that you're extremely cautious about who you let into your home, especially at 1:15 AM. The fact that this guy showed up uninvited, rang your doorbell repeatedly, and then circled around to the back door raises significant red flags.

While it's true that you did offer him a place to warm up in the glassed-in porch, and you seemed to be trying to be kind, it's also clear that you were uncomfortable and trying to set boundaries. You told him he needed to leave, and when he didn't, you reiterated that he needed to go. 

It's not about being heartless, but about prioritizing your own safety and well-being. You have every right to feel uneasy about someone you barely know showing up at your home in the middle of the night, especially given his concerning behavior and the fact that he reeked of alcohol.

It's also worth noting that you didn't just kick him off your porch without giving him any help; you did offer him a place to warm up, and you seemed to be trying to encourage him to leave without being too confrontational.

In hindsight, it might have been helpful to offer him some food or a warm drink to take with him, or even to call a local shelter or hotline to help him get back on his feet. However, given the circumstances, it's not unreasonable that you prioritized your own safety and comfort.

Ultimately, you're not obligated to let strangers into your home, especially if you're uncomfortable or feel threatened.

124,-0.067,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for wanting to let mother struggle alone in her work ? My mother is a great mother. She educated me and my brother very well. She worked hard, alongside my father, to make us live a great childhood. She was quite permissive but we didn't abuse it, and even after my parents separated, we stayed with her, and she did her best.


My brother left the home to work in another town, and so it was her and me. She always wanted to open a shop, and had a lot of ideas : decoration shop, pub, and so many more I can't even remember. And so she did.


She opened her shop 7 months ago. We're living in the apartment above it, and it is quite nice. Or it should be.


When the project started to get real, I was finishing my studies in computer science, and my internship lead me to a job that I can do at home! I started working around the time the shop opened and, at the time, it was clear : I have my job, from Monday to Friday, with hours to do. But she was alone in her project, and the beginning was going to be hard, because of all the paperwork. So I helped her.


And I continued. And she continued asking for help, more and more.
I asked her, why do I have to work more and more? I expected less and less, as she has less and less paperwork to do. I didn't get an answer and she stated that she wasn't expecting this from me. She thought I'd help her. And guilt-shamed me for thinking that I should help her less. This was 4 months ago.


Since then, it became worse. Even more help, I had to ask to change my week-end to be Sunday and Monday in order to be free to help her. I have to help her doing barbecue every Sunday afternoon for her clients. I have to buy what I'm going to cook the Saturday during my work hours. I have to help her around an hour everyday for little things, like checking if somebody enters while she's in the back rooms for a little while or even when she goes to the bathroom.


I want to help her, but it starts to be a bit too much, and I don't want a conversation like the last one. So I help and take this on myself. If I refuse, she guilt-shames me until I feel under enough pressure to accept, or she just reminds me all week that I refused to help her, and I feel bad about it.


But she DOES need help. She's with me in a project way too big for herself, and at the beginning, it was clear between us : I have work and I'm not her employee. She has almost no time for herself, and she struggles to keep up with her work, even with my help.


Now I want my life to get to the next step. I'm nearly 20, single and want to find someone, live in my apartment, and not feel pressured by someone to always be there to help.


But when I talk about it, and ask her how she'll do what I help her with, she just answers ""I'll find a way"", and looks sad. I can't just let her here. But I can't stand helping her everyday on a shop that I do not want to take care of.


So, AITA for wanting to letting my mother alone in this?","Navigating family dynamics and personal responsibilities can be challenging, especially when they overlap with professional obligations. Here's a breakdown to help you reflect on the situation:

1. **Healthy Boundaries**: It's essential to establish clear and healthy boundaries in any relationship, including family. You have your own job, responsibilities, and personal aspirations, and you need to ensure that helping your mother doesn't come at the expense of your own well-being and career.

2. **Open Communication**: From your account, it seems like there might have been a communication breakdown. It’s crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your mother about your limitations and feelings. Express your appreciation for her efforts and explain how the continuous demands are impacting you.

3. **Mutual Understanding**: It's important for both you and your mother to understand each other's perspectives. She may not realize the extent of the burden she's placing on you. Likewise, you need to appreciate the magnitude of her stress and ambition with the shop.

4. **Consistent Support vs. Full Dependency**: Helping your mother initially as she set up the shop was a loving gesture. However, there’s a difference between providing initial support and becoming a full-time, unpaid assistant. It's not unreasonable to seek a balance where you can offer support without sacrificing your personal and professional life.

5. **Finding Solutions**: Perhaps you can help your mother brainstorm alternative solutions for assistance, such as hiring part-time help or seeking volunteers or interns. This could alleviate some of her burdens without relying heavily on you.

6. **Self-Care and Personal Growth**: Remember, it’s equally important to focus on your own life goals and mental health. Prioritizing your well-being isn’t selfish; it’s necessary for your personal development.

In conclusion, you're not necessarily the ""AITA"" for wanting to step back, but it's crucial to handle the situation with sensitivity and care for both your and your mother’s feelings and circumstances. Clear communication and boundary-setting can lead to a healthier relationship and a more sustainable way for your mother to run her shop.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",0.2,-0.067,-0.2,0.0

This New Year's I was back visiting and I was at a bit of a loose end, so I messaged him to see if either/both would be interested in a coffee. He showed up alone, as she'd walked out on him to be with someone else 6 months prior, and things just clicked between us. I met his whole family in the space of a week, including his 5 year old daughter (let's call her Alyssa), who is an absolute joy.

Two months later I came back to live and moved in with him. Yes, it was fast, but we're going strong. They share custody 50/50, and he pays her child support. I have worked hard to build a good relationship with the kid, spending hours playing, and reading bedtime stories.

His ex has ...not taken it well. She messaged me on facebook before I came back, trying to build a connection but said things like ""I hope you're a stronger woman than I am"". I ignored her messages (which I recognise was not ideal), but met up with her for coffee when I got back.

The ex started by worrying that the daughter would be negatively affected, and I agree that doing the right thing by Alyssa is super important. Initially we'd agreed that I would stay with his sister when he had Alyssa, but just before I returned, his sister's partner invited his own struggling colleague to stay with them for a bit, taking their spare room. The ex was upset that the plans changed. This I understand, but it soon came out that she was upset about me living in ""her"" house with ""her"" things.

When she walked out, he bought her out, she owns her own place now. If she's struggling to let go of this one I'm not going to rub her face in it, but it's not my problem. But she's had some serious mental health issues in the past and this, plus feeling that her place in her daughter's life is threatened, destabilised her. She's messaged him horrible things (""you're a fucking psychopath"") and literally screamed at him on the phone. He has been nothing but civil in return.

The three of us have met up for coffee a couple of times and I've tried to reassure her that I'm not trying to be Alyssa's mother. But my words are not enough.

She has met with my partner multiple times and made some pretty nasty comments about me. She's mentioned wanting to physically attack me and is now trying to paint me as some ""other woman"" who was just ""waiting in the wings"", even though she's the one who walked out (and is still with the guy she left my partner for).

She's reaching out now and calling me immature. But I don't want to be friends. Eventually I'd like to build a welcoming family but I'd rather stay away from her for now than say something I regret and won't be able to take back in future.

AITA?","You are not the ""other woman"" who was just ""waiting in the wings"". You and your partner had a genuine connection that developed over time, and you're now in a committed relationship. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to be friends with your partner's ex-wife, given the toxic behavior she's displayed.

Here's why you're not the bad guy in this situation:

1. You didn't pursue your partner while he was still married. You met him when he was already separated, and you didn't know the details of his situation.
2. You've made an effort to build a good relationship with Alyssa, which is great for her emotional well-being. You're not trying to replace her mother or take her place in her life.
3. You've been civil and respectful in your interactions with the ex-wife, despite her nasty comments and behavior.
4. You're not trying to ""win"" or prove a point by being friends with the ex-wife. You're prioritizing your own emotional well-being and avoiding potential conflicts.

That being said, it's important to remember that the ex-wife has mental health issues and is struggling to cope with the changes in her life. It's not your job to fix her problems or be her friend. You can still be respectful and empathetic towards her, but you don't have to engage with her or try to build a friendship.

If you feel uncomfortable or anxious about interacting with the ex-wife, it's okay to set boundaries or limit your interactions with her. You can still prioritize your relationship with your partner and your role in his life without feeling guilty or obligated to be friends with someone who's being toxic and manipulative.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you don't have to tolerate abusive or toxic behavior from anyone, including your partner's ex-wife.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.8, ""Julian"": 0.8}",1.6,0.067,-0.8,0.8
128,-0.4,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I hung out with another guy? My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years now, but we don't go to the same college. We're kind of LDR and we see eachother about twice a month on the weekends. Back in September we had a huge fight that led to us almost breaking up. We made up after, but I was still reeling a bit as it was the worst fight we've ever had and brought up some issues we have with eachother that we had never openly communicated before. A couple days after we make up, our relationship feels a bit awkward and unsteady but we both feel like we've finally voiced our feelings and are hoping to work on the issues. 

Onto why I might (probably) be an asshole: I meet a guy at my college literally two days after we've had this fight and make up. We were both waiting for a vending machine and he had a boosted board with him. I'm into skateboarding and was kinda looking at getting a boosted board  so I asked him about it and he started telling me about how nice it was and how much it cost and stuff. Then he asked me about my major and we talked about school for a little bit while I got my food. I say bye and am walking away with my food when he asks me for my snapchat, and I give it to him. He messaged me and we talked about our school and the weather and shit for maybe a week and then he asks if I wanna hang out. Ngl I really wanted to try his board so I say okay. I've been telling my boyfriend about this the entire time and he says he's fine with me going skateboarding with this guy. So I go skateboard with him and afterwards we sit down at a Starbucks and talk for a bit. I got the vibe it wasn't really a date but it also kinda could have been. I didn't mention having a boyfriend. We parted ways and didn't talk again until a couple weeks ago. 

He messaged me asking how I was doing and I probably should have just ignored him but I didn't. I felt rude just leaving him on read. We make small talk and he asks me if I wanna hang out and I say okay. The day before we're supposed to meet up I slip the fact that I have a boyfriend into conversation. He's still down to meet up so we did. We haven't talked since. I told my boyfriend he was texting me again but I didn't tell him that we met up. I told my bf that I had already told this guy that I was taken and he seemed satisfied. My boyfriend and I are in a better place in our relationship right now and the things we fought about are getting better. I feel like I should tell my bf that I hung out with the skateboard kid again but I don't know if I should at this point. Literally nothing happened except some boring conversation and telling my boyfriend now would probably just make him upset. AITA if I don't tell him?","You should have been more open with your boyfriend about your interactions with this other guy, especially considering the recent turmoil in your relationship. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Trust and Honesty**: A healthy relationship is built on trust and honesty. Even if nothing inappropriate happened, keeping this information from your boyfriend could erode that trust.

2. **Boundaries**: You mentioned that your boyfriend was initially okay with you going skateboarding with this guy, but that doesn't necessarily extend to multiple meetings, especially when you didn't mention having a boyfriend the first time.

3. **Communication**: You've both been working on your communication issues. This is a good opportunity to practice open and honest communication.

Given these points, you might be an asshole if you don't tell him. It's important to consider his feelings and the potential impact on your relationship. You don't have to tell him in a way that will cause unnecessary drama, but it's likely better to be honest and upfront.

If you're worried about his reaction, you could approach the conversation by emphasizing that nothing happened and that you're telling him now because you want to be open and honest.

This Monday my mom told my wife and me that she's taking our daughter to the local water park. It's a big water park, and my wife and I haven't been there since we were kids. We weren't comfortable with our daughter going there with our parents because of how big it is, and the fact that we're unfamiliar with it. It would be fine with us if my mom took her there some day after we've gone to see it and are more comfortable with it.

When I told my Mom this, she was livid. First she said that I'm forcing her to break her promise to my daughter. I told her that she should have asked us if she could take our daughter to the water park before telling our daughter that they were going to go, and made sure we were okay with it, and if she had done that she would have known how we felt about it and wouldn't have promised to her that they would go.

 She also said that this means we don't trust her, but I told her that of course we trust her, we let her take our daughter lots of places. It's not that we don't trust her, it's that we're not comfortable with the water park and we want to check it out first.

Anyway, now my mom is still watching our daughter when we're at work, but she's barely speaking to us, and she's clearly still really pissed a couple of days later.

ETA: I forgot to mention that another part of the reason I'm hesitant is that (A) my daughter is afraid of slides, and (B) my daughter is afraid of loud noises, and (C) there's a local rec center we've taken my daughter to where there's a big bucket that occasionally splashes water all over the place, and my daughter is *fucking terrified* of that. I told my mom that I wanted to see the place first to make sure there's nothing like that which would stress her out, and she said she ""knows how to handle"" my daughter's tantrums/meltdowns, and I should ""trust her judgement"" about whether there's anything there that will stress her out.","NTA.  Your concerns are completely valid and reasonable.  It's your child, and you have the right to set boundaries about where she goes and who takes her.  Your mom overstepped by making plans without your consent, especially given your daughter's anxieties.

While your mom framed it as breaking a promise to your daughter, the promise was made without consulting you, the parents.  The real promise was to *you* to care for your daughter, and that includes respecting your wishes about her activities.  Your mom's reaction is disproportionate to the situation.  She should be prioritizing your daughter's well-being and respecting your parenting decisions, not throwing a tantrum because she can't do what she wants.

The fact that your daughter is afraid of slides and loud noises, and has had a negative experience with a similar water feature, makes your hesitation even more justified.  Your mom dismissing your concerns and claiming she ""knows how to handle"" your daughter's reactions is dismissive and frankly, a little arrogant.  It's not about trust; it's about responsible childcare and understanding your daughter's needs.

Your explanation to your mom was clear and respectful.  Her continued anger is her problem to deal with, not yours.  You handled this appropriately.  Consider having a calm conversation with her later to reiterate your concerns and your need for her to respect your decisions regarding your daughter's care.  However, don't feel obligated to appease her anger.  Your daughter's well-being is paramount.

So I told my wife about it and she thinks I'm being silly and is upset that I feel embarrassed. AITA here.","NTA (Not The Asshole). It's completely understandable that you'd feel embarrassed about public displays of affection (PDAs) in front of your 13-year-old daughter. At this age, kids often start to develop a sense of modesty and may find their parents' affectionate behavior awkward or cringeworthy.

It's not that you're opposed to affection in general, but rather that you're considerate of your daughter's feelings and don't want to make her uncomfortable. It's a normal part of parenting to navigate these kinds of situations and set boundaries that respect your child's growing independence.

Your wife's reaction is understandable, too - she might feel like you're being overly sensitive or that you're not allowing her to express her affection for you. However, it's essential to have an open conversation with her about how you feel and why. You can explain that it's not about not wanting to show affection, but about being mindful of your daughter's feelings and avoiding potentially embarrassing situations.

It's also worth considering that your daughter's laughter might not be just about embarrassment, but also about her natural reaction to seeing her parents being affectionate. It's a normal part of her development to start to differentiate herself from her parents and establish her own sense of identity.

Ultimately, finding a balance between showing affection and being considerate of your daughter's feelings is key. You and your wife can discuss and find a compromise that works for both of you, such as being more mindful of PDAs when your daughter is around or finding other ways to show affection that don't make her uncomfortable.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.6,0.233,0.0,0.6

Some background: I am a huge baseball fan and my entire family knows it. I have been to lots of games at my home stadium but never an Opening Day game. 

Today my mom texts me to tell me that her and my sister are going to spend the night before opening day in the city and then go to the game. So I asked “is this an invitation or are you just rubbing it in?” She said “just rubbing it in” and then proceeded to talk about why they’re going. At first I thought she would extend an invitation but she never did. 

So I told my wife that I’m going to buy tickets and go separately to the same game and hope to run into her and honestly be kind of petty about it. My wife thinks that I would be TA.

Wanting to go to the game on your own is perfectly reasonable, but it's important to consider how your actions might come across.

If you go to the game without telling them and then ""hope to run into her and honestly be kind of petty about it,"" it could create unnecessary tension or conflict. This approach might make you come across as passive-aggressive, which might not be the best way to address the situation.

Instead, consider being open about your feelings. You could tell your mom and sister that you'd love to go to the game as well and see if it’s possible for you to join them. If not, you can still go on your own, but it's better for everyone to know in advance rather than being surprised or feeling awkward when you encounter them at the event.

Ultimately, going to the game isn't the issue; it's about how you choose to handle the situation. Being upfront and avoiding pettiness could help maintain a positive relationship with your family.

I, on the other hand, have an extreme sensitivity to caffeine and therefore avoid coffee like the plague. Literally have never tasted coffee and likely never will. 

My wife and I take turns doing the dishes. Invariably there are dishes related to her coffee drinking every single day. Given that I don’t, and never will, use any of these coffee-related items, I don’t wash them. I leave them in the sink for her to wash when it’s her turn to do the dishes. I will certainly wash mugs that she used and put them in the dishwasher, but cleaning everything else is tedious and time consuming. 

My wife feels as this is inconsiderate as we share household chores, however I feel as though this is something directly related to her it should be her sole responsibility. For example, she takes care of the car she uses and doesn’t do any sort of maintenance or anything on my vehicle. 

So Reddit, AITA?


Edit: Many have brought up laundry as an example of a shared chore. We do our laundry completely separate. She does not wash, dry, fold, or put away my clothes nor I hers.","It's understandable that you want to approach household chores in a way that feels fair to both of you, but there are a few factors to consider here.

First, it's important to recognize that in a shared living situation, division of labor often includes tasks related to maintaining the space you both use, even if one person doesn't directly benefit from every single chore. For instance, you might clean areas of the home or do housework that doesn't directly relate to your personal activities but contributes to the overall household functioning.

Second, comparing coffee-related dishes to car maintenance might not be a completely fair comparison because dishes are part of the daily routine and maintaining a hygienic home, while car maintenance is often less frequent and considered a personal responsibility.

Finally, you might want to have an open discussion with your wife about finding a fair balance in division of household chores. Perhaps there's a compromise that could be reached, such as alternating who washes the coffee items or finding a balance where each of you takes on tasks the other dislikes in exchange for them doing the same.

In most relationships, flexibility and compromise can go a long way in solving disagreements around chores. It may be worth exploring why this particular issue feels important to both of you and how you can reach a solution that feels equitable.

In conclusion, whether you're the ""AITA"" or not largely depends on the overall context of how household chores are managed in your relationship.

I don't know if he forgot to get one or didn't know he was supposed to get one or what (even though the professor told us we needed to bring one), but this guy didn't have one.

I cut him some slack since he is a freshman and this could have been his first experience with a scantron, and everyone makes mistakes now and then. Come time for exam 2, he doesn't have one again.

I don't think you're the asshole here. While helping someone once is a kind gesture, there's a reasonable expectation that college students should learn from these experiences.

You already:
- Helped him the first time by giving him a scantron
- Told him exactly where to get them for free
- Observed that he had ample opportunity to get one before the second exam

College is partly about developing personal responsibility. By not enabling his repeated lack of preparation, you might actually be doing him a favor in the long run. The freshman needs to learn to prepare for exams properly, and sometimes a small consequence (having to quickly find a solution himself) is the best teacher.

That said, while you weren't obligated to help him again, neither choice makes you an ""asshole"" - it's just a judgment call about where to draw the boundary between helpfulness and enabling dependence.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.1, ""Julian"": 0.4}",0.30000000000000004,0.267,0.1,0.4

This was in the evening, so I was rushing to get the van back in time before they closed at 9pm.

Their policy is designed to ensure the vans are returned with a full tank of gas to avoid disputes and ensure fair treatment for all renters.  You agreed to the terms when you rented the van.  Driving the van, even for a short distance, constitutes usage, and they are well within their rights to require a full tank upon return.

TLDR: a friend owes me money and when I asked her for it long after the agreed upon payment date, she ghosted me. So I’m considering taking her to small claims court but other friends think that’s an asshole move.

The long version:  A close friend of mine was trying to grow her business as a horse trainer by purchasing retired racehorses, putting some training on them and selling.

She bought a horse with me in mind as a surprise although I really wasn’t in the market. I ended up buying that horse from her at 4 times what she paid for it and she only put 6-8 rides on him. She also failed to mention that he had ulcers so I’ve spent another 3k on diagnostics and treatment. But it is what it is and I ended up with a great horse and helped her business.

A few months after I bought my horse, she found another prospect but didn’t have the cash to buy him and asked if I would. We discussed and came to the agreement that I’d give her the purchase money, she’d put 30 days on him, sell and pay me back.

That was Feb 2019. Expected turnaround for payment was March/April. 

In April, she filed for divorce and was busy selling her house and moving so wasn’t riding. I understood that time and money were very tight especially given she has kids so I didn’t push.

All summer she vacationed and partied like a 21YO. No riding. I inquired and she said it was “too hot to ride”.

In September I asked about when she was going to get him sold and she told me that her assistant really wanted the horse. Great! Let’s sell!  Only assistant doesn’t have much money and would I just “gift”. Fuck no. I didn’t get a deal on my horse, in fact I paid many times more! And this horse I bought to help her out. Not even asking to split profit. Just wanted the seed money back!  

Last month, she remarried her ex husband and moved again. Still has horse.

I’ve texted and messaged. She wrote back saying that I should be more understanding of their “family circumstances”. 

At this point, she isn’t responding to texts or calls. So I’m thinking about filing in small claims.  I have documentation of the agreement and I feel like I’ve been more than patient.

But....several other people I’ve discussed this with think it would be a total asshole move. She’s been through a lot, etc.

I really don’t want to be a jerk. I just want my money. I’m not wealthy. I keep about 3k in play for rescue, rehab, rehome activities for horses and dogs and friend knows this. I can’t help anyone else til I replenish the fund and I’ve had a lot of unexpected expenses with the horse I bought from her. So I’m just kind of pissed. And I need the money.

So...WIBTA if I took her to court?","NTA.  Your friends are focusing on your friend's personal circumstances and minimizing the fact that she borrowed money and hasn't repaid it, despite repeated attempts to contact her.  That's a serious breach of trust and a financial obligation she agreed to.

While her divorce and remarriage are undoubtedly stressful, that doesn't absolve her of her debt.  You've been incredibly patient, giving her ample time to repay you.  Her lack of communication and the excuse about the ""family circumstances"" is simply unacceptable.  She actively chose to ignore your attempts to resolve this amicably.

You have documentation of the agreement, which is crucial for a small claims case.  Going to small claims court is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate way to recover the money she owes you.  It's not an ""asshole move,"" it's protecting your financial interests after exhausting all other options.  Your friends are putting emotional considerations ahead of a clear financial obligation.

The additional cost of the line was about $30 dollars so we agreed that at the beginning of each year he would pay me $360 for the year. In January of 2018, I told him that I no longer wanted him on my plan but he said he was too busy to deal with getting his own plan so I agreed to do it for one more year. Over the course of 2018, we had a falling out and our communication became limited to a few emails related to family matters (health of older relatives).

In December of 2018, I got a letter from the Social Security Administration saying that I owed them money. After some digging, I learned that SS payments had been made to him fraudulently on my behalf when I was very young (please don't consider this in the judgment of the phone issue). I was able to resolve the issue but I decided that I did not want to be connected to him on any accounts.

On Jan 1, 2019, I sent him an email saying that I wanted him to transfer his phone line to his own account and that I would give him until Jan 31 to do it. I called the phone company to give him all the permissions to go into any store and transfer the number.

A few days after Jan 31 he called me and was very angry that I had canceled his number. I referred him to the email and he said he never saw it.

In order to recover the number, I needed to reinstate it on my account and then give him permission to transfer it again. I agreed to do this and he agreed to move the number by the end of February.

After the number was reinstated my Dad had some medical issues. He was also traveling and he wanted to transfer the number to a different carrier that was only available where he lives and not where he currently was. So the end of February deadline turned into whenever he gets back home.

I just sent him an email saying that I will cancel the line on Mar 31 and if he wants the number he needs to transfer it before then. There is no negotiation.

I feel like a pushover at the same time that I feel like I should be considerate of his situation with his health. AITA?

Also, I did not grow up with him and he did (edit: didn't) ever support me financially.","The complexities of family dynamics!

I'm going to provide my analysis, and then you can decide if you agree or not.

**Your actions:**

1. You initially agreed to add your dad to your plan because of his bad credit, and you negotiated a payment arrangement.
2. You gave him notice in December 2018 that you wanted him to transfer his line to his own account, but he didn't take action.
3. You reinstated the line in February 2019 to facilitate the transfer, but he didn't meet the deadline.
4. You're now giving him another deadline (March 31) to transfer the number, with no room for negotiation.

**The situation:**

1. Your dad's health issues and travel plans might be legitimate concerns, but they shouldn't excuse his lack of follow-through.
2. You've already accommodated him twice, and it's reasonable to set a deadline for the transfer.
3. You didn't grow up with him, and he didn't financially support you, which might reduce your emotional obligation to him.

**My verdict:**

You're not a pushover; you're setting boundaries and being clear about your expectations. While it's understandable that you want to be considerate of your dad's situation, you've already been flexible and accommodating. It's time to prioritize your own needs and set a clear deadline for the transfer.

If your dad can't meet the deadline, it's his responsibility to take action and find a solution. You've done your part in facilitating the transfer; now it's up to him to make it happen.

**Final thoughts:**

1. It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries with family members who don't respect your needs.
2. You've already demonstrated empathy and understanding by accommodating your dad twice; now it's time to prioritize your own needs.
3. Remember that you're not responsible for your dad's financial or health issues; you're only responsible for your own actions and decisions.

But, while we were driving back home, she knew that we would be driving past a Dunkin Donuts. She wanted me to stop so she could get herself a “birthday donut.” I said no. She was upset about it, saying she just wanted a donut and she’d just done this long hike to please me on her birthday. I argued calmly that she didn’t want to undo all the work of the hike by getting a donut. She said the one she wanted is 350 calories (which I doubt is true) and would fit into her day. I pointed out she’d probably be eating cake later. We didn’t stop and she sulked about it on the whole ride back. When we got home, she told her mother, who of course sided with her and went on a rant about how our daughter’s birthday shouldn’t be a time I’m preaching healthy eating. 

I am trying to protect her health at every turn, when she spends most of her free time with her mother. Am I really the asshole for not wanting to stop and get her a fatty donut after a nice hike?","YTA.  While your concern for your daughter's health is understandable, your approach was incredibly insensitive and ineffective.  Refusing a single donut on her 19th birthday, especially after a hike she did to please you, was a heavy-handed and punitive tactic.  It's likely to have backfired, creating resentment and damage to your relationship with her.

Your daughter is an adult.  You can't control her diet.  Trying to micromanage her food choices, especially in such a public and humiliating way, is not going to help her lose weight.  In fact, it's more likely to lead to disordered eating habits.  A much more effective approach would be to support her in making healthier choices by modeling healthy behavior yourself, and perhaps suggesting healthy activities you can do together, rather than forcing a hike and then punishing her for wanting a treat.

Your wife is right; her birthday shouldn't be a lecture on healthy eating.  Focus on building a supportive and loving relationship with your daughter, rather than trying to control her every move.  Consider family counseling to help you all communicate more effectively and address your daughter's weight in a healthy and constructive way.  It's a complex issue that requires a sensitive and collaborative approach, not a power struggle.

138,0.0,manual,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for ruining my family’s movie by vaping in the theater? I recently quit smoking before going home for the holidays. While staying with my family in a small rural city, I went to see the new big box office hit at our local theater with my mom and aunt. Not really my bag, but hey the seats reclined and they served  beer so why not. 
With about 10 minutes left in the movie the guy next to me says loudly “ARE YOU VAPING? SERIOUSLY?!” Sure enough, my [insert name brand small vaping device] was in my hand. I didn’t realize how automatic the habit had become, plus I was completely engrossed in the last minutes of the film. So I said, “my bad dude, I won’t do it again,” and put it away.
He kept saying thinks like “this is bullshit” and “I don’t know what’s in that thing” and “my KIDS are here” LOUDLY. So I packed my things, got up, and said to my family “you guys stay and enjoy the rest of the film.”
The guy FOLLOWED me out and told a manager that he noted our seat numbers and that I should be ARRESTED. He was at least 6’ I’m a small-ish 5’7” girl, so it was a bit scary. My mom also came out and the manager came out and asked me to leave. Which is fine, I fucked up. I asked her if my family could stay and finish the film, but at this point the guy was still yelling that his “kids are here” and “I don’t know what’s in that thing.” So we all left.
My mom yelled at me as soon as we got back and my aunt is furious with me. I was emotionally exhausted by being yelled at by a stranger and my family, so I retreated to the guest room for the rest of the night. Tonight is my last night home and I feel bad for not spending more time with my mom, but honestly I don’t have anymore mental energy. Am I the asshole here?","It sounds like you made a mistake by vaping in the theater, which is generally not allowed and can be disruptive to others. However, the way the situation escalated was largely due to the other man's reaction and your family's response. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Your Mistake**: You were vaping in a public space where it's not allowed, and you should have been more aware of your surroundings. This was an oversight on your part.

2. **The Man's Reaction**: The man's response was disproportionate and aggressive. He could have politely asked you to stop or informed the staff without making a scene.

3. **Your Family's Reaction**: Your family's immediate anger and lack of support for you in the situation could have been handled better.

Given these points, you're not the sole asshole in this situation, but you did make a mistake that led to the disruption. Here are a few steps you could take:

- **Apologize**: Apologize to your family for the disruption and for not being more mindful of the rules. Explain that you didn't realize how automatic the habit had become.

- **Communicate**: Talk to your family about how the situation made you feel. Explain that you were emotionally exhausted and needed some space.

- **Make Amends**: Try to spend some quality time with your mom before you leave. Maybe suggest a quiet activity like a walk or a meal together.

In the future, be more mindful of your vaping habits in public spaces and ensure you're following the rules and respecting others.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": -0.4}",0.8,0.0,-0.4,0.4
139,-0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for assuming that the movie “Pretty Woman” had a trivial ending Long story short: my girlfriend adores this classic 1990-s movie called “Pretty woman” with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. It tells a story about a ruthless billionaire who falls in love with a hooker and becomes more human in the end. I’ve never seen this film before and we agreed that we would watch it together today (she would watch it 6 or 7 times). So we watched it and SPOILER ALERT in the end Gere’s character develops to a more compassionate person. He cancels the deal that would put other people at risk and so on. And Roberts’ character decides to quit hooking and go to college. But! In the very final Gere on his white limousine rides to her apartment with flowers and they leave this place together. 

Now here’s where fun begins. After we had finished watching, I presumed that as a director I wouldn’t rather put in the movie the limousine and shit because it’s a cliche. It’s like modern Cinderella. I said that it could’ve been better if they split up after making each other better. It would make a nice, bittersweet ending. I added that this final was quite trivial. 

I never thought she would take it so personally. She argued that it was the best ending in the history of cinematography. She almost cried. Eventually she turned her back with the words “here’s not trivial ending, good night” and IMMEDIATELY fall asleep. So here I am sitting on a toilet while my girlfriend is sleeping in the next room, quite offended. I wrote this post on TIFU and they suggested that I should post it here as well. So, enjoy...

TL;DR assumed that the ending of “Pretty woman” was trivial, got a response from my girlfriend “here’s not trivial ending, good night” and was turned down

PS. Sorry for spelling, I only learn English. Articles are my biggest problem!","It's understandable that you wanted to share your thoughts on the movie, especially since you were experiencing it for the first time and discussing different perspectives on films can be fun. However, it's essential to remember that people can have strong emotional connections to movies, sometimes due to nostalgia or personal experiences. Your girlfriend seems to have a deep affection for ""Pretty Woman"" and its ending, which she regards as a classic romantic moment.

You’re not necessarily in the wrong for expressing your opinion, but it might have been more thoughtful to acknowledge her feelings and appreciation for the film before sharing your critique. For instance, you could have first said something like, “I can see why you love the ending, it’s very romantic,” before offering your take on a different possible ending.

To address the situation, consider having a sincere conversation with her where you express that you didn't mean to diminish her enjoyment of the movie. You might say something like, “I realized afterward that my comments might have come across as dismissive of something you really enjoy, and that wasn’t my intention. I’m glad we got to watch it together and would love to hear more about why it’s special to you.” This approach highlights your respect for her feelings and interest in her perspective, which may help smooth things over.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.2, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -1.0, ""Julian"": -0.2}",1.2,-0.333,-1.0,0.2
140,0.333,manual,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for cleaning out my apartments fridge of food that made it smell like DEATH? Ok so I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with one girl now, used to be two but one left (THANK GOD) and the other stayed.

BoTh of these girls are slobs to the point of leaving trash to pile up and make the apartment smell like garbage and dishes in the sink to the point that if anything else was put in the sink there would be an avalanche of moldy dishes everywhere, trust me, its happened, and they just stayed on the floor.

I'm not perfect. I'm a bit of a mess myself, but there is a difference between being messy and being disgusting. I may not be able to see the surface of my desk due to school and art supplies, but I know when to take out the trash and how to do my own dishes.

I don't live in my apartment during the summer due to a better paying job back home but I come up every once and a while to check on the place and get away from my mother. Its always a fucking mess.

Garbage bags everywhere, pizza boxes everywhere, sink FULL of dishes and gnats just chilling on every surface due to the level of filth that the bitch had left.

I clean it all.

I throw away most of the plastic dishes that were in the sink due to the level of nastiness that covered them. Think that gross algae stuff that grows in stagnant ponds. That, but worse.

I cleaned the kitchen from top to bottom, something that hadn't happened since I stopped using it due to the pigs that I lived with.

Then, I looked in the fridge.

You wouldn't have been able to fit a bottle of water in that fridge it was so full. It also stank like something died in it.

I cleaned it, top to bottom, and threw out everything that wasn't alcohol and wasn't out of date and moldy.

Everything else went in the trash. Pizza boxes, take out containers, tupplewear, milk that had been in there since may, eggs that had been in there for a VERY long time, and 7 MORE pizza boxes went into 4 trashbags that got chocked FULL by nothing but shit from the fridge.

It took me 4 trips to take all the garbage to the dumpster, and I have a 4th floor apartment and its over 100 degrees every day. My legs and arms were SCREAMING after all those stairs.

I then proceeded to clean the fridge, top to bottom, and didn't stop until the thing smelled only of lemon and bleach.

I put the 3 things that I deemed ok to stay.

An unopened bottle of red powerade that I later drank because there was nothing else and I felt as though I deserved it for all the hard work I just did to clean the apartment, some beer and wine coolers, and a tub of butter were all that I put back in the fridge.

Fast forward a few days, I get a nasty call from my roommate asking why I had thrown out all of her food. I told her that what I threw out was either moldy or out of date.

She said that I was a bitch for touching what wasn't mine and that she had bought all that food the week before. I call bullshit.

So, am I the asshole for cleaning the fridge that smelled like death?","Based on the information you've provided, it seems like you were not the asshole in this situation. Here's why:

1. **Health and Safety**: The fridge was so dirty and smelly that it posed a health risk. Food that has gone bad can cause food poisoning and attract pests.

2. **Shared Space**: You all share the apartment and the fridge. It's not fair that your roommate's negligence affected the living conditions for everyone.

3. **Communication**: While it would have been ideal to communicate with your roommate before throwing out the food, given the state of the apartment and the fridge, it seems like you were dealing with an urgent health and hygiene issue.

4. **Roommate's Claims**: It's hard to believe that all the food was bought the week before, given the state of it. It's more likely that your roommate was just upset about losing food they didn't want to admit was spoiled.

However, in the future, it might be helpful to:

- Communicate with your roommate about the state of the apartment and the fridge.
- Give them a chance to clean up or remove spoiled food before you do it yourself.
- Document the state of the apartment and the fridge with photos, in case there are disputes later.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.6, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.39999999999999997,0.333,0.2,0.6

I login and see that some person has been grinding away at my account, unlocked a bunch of stuff and is 24 levels shy of finishing up this season pass. Should I be an asshole and let him finish it before I change the password? \^\_\^","The sweet taste of vindication and the dilemma of digital ethics!

While it's understandable that you might be tempted to let the hacker finish the season pass as a form of ""punishment"" or ""entertainment,"" I'd argue that it's not necessary or justified. Here's why:

1. **It's your account**: The hacker has already done significant damage by accessing and using your account without permission. You've likely lost control over your in-game items, progress, and personal data.
2. **The hacker's actions are unauthorized**: The person has been using your account without your consent, which is a clear breach of trust and potentially a crime.
3. **You have the right to secure your account**: As the rightful owner, it's your responsibility to protect your account and its contents. Changing the password and securing your account is a reasonable step to take.

Letting the hacker finish the season pass might seem like a form of trolling or revenge, but it's not worth the potential risks:

* The hacker might still have access to your account, even if you're letting them finish the season pass.
* You might inadvertently give them more opportunities to exploit your account or steal more of your in-game items.

Instead, consider taking the following steps:

1. **Change your password immediately**: Secure your account by changing your password to a strong, unique one.
2. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**: If you haven't already, enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to your account.
3. **Contact Epic Games support**: Reach out to Epic Games' support team to report the incident and request their assistance in securing your account and potentially recovering any lost progress or items.
4. **Review your account settings**: Take this opportunity to review your account settings, ensure that no unauthorized changes have been made, and update your security settings as needed.

In conclusion, while it might be tempting to let the hacker finish the season pass, it's not worth the potential risks.

142,0.067,calculated,R: YTA AI: NTA,"AITA for demanding my girlfriend call limes by the right name? Before we start, I just want to say I love my girlfriend a lot and i’m really happy with her. This is a very minor thing, I just want judgement from a third party! So please don’t be aggressively mean. 

Backstory details: 
My girlfriend is Mexican. Spanish is her first language. She moved from mexico to the United States at age five. We are both twenty two now, so she’s been in the US for 17 years. 

My girlfriend and I only speak English with each other. I’ve asked her to teach me Spanish, but she finds it difficult because she’s a native speaker so she just knows things and can’t explain them to me, which I understand. I am learning Arabic for my graduate degree so I can’t study Spanish on my own time right now, but plan to in the future once I finish my degree. 

We have lived together for over a year. She works full time while I’m in school. We split the chores/daily responsibilities and one of mine is the grocery shopping. 

Okay so that’s the backstory. 

The issue is this: 

In the area where my girlfriend is from, she (and her family and friends, I checked) call the green citrus fruit (what i would call a lime) and the yellow fruit (what i would call a lemon) “limones” which translates to lemon in english. So they call both of them by the same name, to be clear. 

At first I didn’t know this. So whenever she asked me to buy lemons, I bought the yellow fruit. Then one day we went to the store together and she called the limes lemons and I was like ???? and the discrepancy was revealed. 

Now, whenever we are cooking or I am going to the store, she says lemons (but she means limes). I said, well what if you want the yellow lemons? And she said “I would never use a yellow lemon” so. But for some reason it really bothers me! Like, is it /that/ hard to call it a lime a lime, even if you learned it differently? But her counter is, I should just always assume she means “lime” when she says “lemon”, but for some reason this drives me crazy!!

So, solve this discussion for us. 

AITA for wanting her to call limes limes??","The eternal debate of linguistic nuance! Don't worry, I'll provide a neutral and gentle judgment.

Firstly, it's great to hear that you love and appreciate your girlfriend, and that this is a minor issue. It's actually a fascinating example of how language and cultural background can influence our perceptions.

In this case, it's not about being ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but rather about understanding and respecting each other's linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Your girlfriend's usage of ""limones"" to refer to both limes and lemons is a common phenomenon in some Spanish-speaking countries, including Mexico. This doesn't mean she's incorrect; it simply reflects her native dialect.

Your frustration stems from the fact that, in your everyday experience, ""lemon"" typically refers to the yellow fruit, and ""lime"" refers to the green one. You're not asking her to change her entire linguistic system, but rather to be more precise in your shared communication.

However, your girlfriend's counterpoint is also valid: if she's consistently used ""limones"" to refer to limes in her life, it's reasonable to assume that you can infer her intended meaning. It's not a huge cognitive leap, especially given your shared language and context.

So, AITA for wanting her to call limes limes? Not necessarily. It's understandable that you'd want clarity and precision in your communication, especially when it comes to cooking and grocery shopping.

That being said, considering your girlfriend's background and the fact that she's been using this terminology for 17 years, it's also reasonable to assume that she might not be willing or able to change her usage. Perhaps a compromise can be reached:

1. You can ask her to specify ""limes"" when you need the green citrus fruit, and she can try to use that term more frequently in your shared conversations.
2. When she says ""lemons,"" you can politely ask for clarification: ""Do you mean the green limes or the yellow lemons?""
3. You can also make a lighthearted joke about it, acknowledging that it's a quirk of her dialect, and that you're learning to appreciate the nuances of her language.

Ultimately, it's not about ""winning"" the argument or being ""right."" It's about understanding, respecting, and appreciating each other's differences. You're already doing a great job by acknowledging and discussing this issue; now, it's just a matter of finding a mutually comfortable solution.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.0, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2

She told me basically what I’m shocked to think they’re teaching children that age and then she showed me a condom that was given to her.

This morning I walked right into the principals office and demanded to know why they were giving my daughter condoms in sex Ed (as well as why they’re teaching her about oral and anal sex other more advanced topics that are age inappropriate).

The principal insisted that I leave immediately and to instead send a letter if I feel so strongly against “proper sex education”. She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.

On the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.

Guys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.","YTA.  While it's understandable to be concerned about the content of your child's sex education, your approach was completely inappropriate.  Bursting into the principal's office and demanding answers is not the way to address your concerns.  A calm and respectful letter expressing your concerns would have been far more effective.

The school likely has a curriculum designed to provide age-appropriate sex education, and while you may disagree with the specifics,  the fact remains that many experts believe comprehensive sex education, including information about various sexual acts and safe sex practices, is important for children's health and well-being.  Condoms are a part of safe sex practices, and providing them isn't necessarily promoting sexual activity; it's about harm reduction if a child chooses to engage in sexual activity.

The school resource officer's comment is irrelevant; he's not an educator or administrator and his opinion on how you should handle the situation doesn't change the fact that you acted inappropriately.

Instead of focusing on your anger, consider calmly discussing your concerns with the school administration through proper channels.  If you remain unsatisfied, you can explore alternative options, but escalating the situation with a disruptive outburst was not the right course of action.

Anyways, my Sister at 23 is really young and is not done her schooling. I am horribly concerned for her, feeling that not using birth control will ruin her life. My sister simply responded that they will use 'natural family planning' and 'pulling out' and will just have very little sexual activity for the next two years till she finishes her studies.

However, it's important to respect her personal beliefs and autonomy, especially since they are deeply rooted in her religious convictions.

While you may believe that you're trying to help her avoid potential pitfalls, your sister may perceive your constant attempts to convince her as interference in her personal life. It's crucial to find a balance between expressing your concerns and respecting her choices.

Instead of pushing your views on her, you might consider having a conversation about the potential challenges she might face in the future due to her decision, without directly advocating for birth control. Offer support and resources if she ever decides to reconsider, but avoid being pushy or judgmental.

In the end, it's your sister's life, and she needs to make decisions that she feels are best for her. You can express your concerns and offer help, but ultimately, it's up to her to make the choice that feels right for her.

So my husband went to the bar on Saturday and met this man - who apparently asked him (and another friend of his) if they had a basement because he got kicked out of the place he was staying and was wondering if he could stay in one of their basements. Granted my husband has never met this man before. So he texts me while I was working and asked what he should do because he feels bad for this guy. 

We both have big hearts (like jeez) it's cold outside, we live in WI and this guy apparently had all of his belongings in his car. I said that if he didn't have anywhere to stay that night I didn't have a problem with him staying one night until he can figure out other arrangements. So ""Stan"" ""moves in"" - essentially brings his entire carload of stuff into our basement and then when i started talking to him he was basically asking if he could rent out our basement. This wasn't what I signed up for.

Basically, I've been avoiding my house since Saturday and last night I lost it on my husband and basically said it wasn't fair that all of a sudden I have this strange man living in my basement. We didn't know his situation, why he was homeless, why the other people kicked him out, what his last name was etc. My husband understood where I was coming from and then apologized to me for putting me in this position. I then said that he needs to find a new place to stay sooner than later - by Christmas at the VERY LATEST and it will be my husbands job to tell Stan this. 

I got up this morning and went to work feeling ok since we talked about this last night. My husband had the day off, so then about an hour ago I get a text from my husband saying that Stan is leaving today - and my husband basically blamed it all on me because I wasn't happy about the whole situation. Stan apparently was crying and was really upset (rightfully so) and of course my husband needed to tell me that.

&#x200B;

So AITA??","The age-old debate: whose side are you on?

In this situation, I think you're not entirely in the wrong, but also not entirely in the right. Here's why:

1. You did initially agree to let Stan stay for one night, and your husband did try to help someone in need. So, you can't entirely blame him for the situation.
2. However, you didn't explicitly agree to rent out your basement or make Stan a permanent resident. You did mention it wasn't what you signed up for, and it's reasonable to feel that way.
3. Your husband should have communicated more clearly with you about the situation and the potential long-term implications before inviting Stan to stay.
4. You did express your concerns and boundaries to your husband, and he apologized for putting you in this position. That's a good step.

Now, about your husband's reaction:

1. He did apologize for putting you in this situation, which shows he's aware of your concerns.
2. However, blaming you for Stan's departure might have been unnecessary. He could have acknowledged your feelings and concerns without shifting the blame.

So, AITA? Not entirely. You have a right to feel uncomfortable with the situation, and your husband should have been more considerate of your feelings and boundaries. However, your husband also did try to help someone in need, and you should have been more open to finding a solution that worked for both parties.

Perhaps a compromise could have been reached, such as finding temporary accommodation for Stan until he gets back on his feet or helping him connect with local resources for the homeless.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.2, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.2,0.067,0.0,0.2

She was going on about something stupid when she started banging something, I was trying to sleep so I open my bedroom door and told her to shut up, apparently that was enough to solicit a bombardment of harassment with lines like ""I hate you why don't you move out if it's so bad honestly"" ""I want nothing more than for you to leave"" ""both you and your brother can get lost for all I care"" and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Your mom has a history of saying hurtful things when she's drunk, and it's clear that she's struggling with substance abuse and possibly other emotional issues. When she was sober the next morning, she apologized and acknowledged that her behavior was due to her intoxication.

When you brought up the comment she made when she was drunk, you weren't trying to attack her or hold her accountable in a mean-spirited way. You were simply reminding her of a previous conversation, possibly to make a point or to express your feelings.

147,-0.333,calculated,R: YTA AI: YTA,"AITA for not inviting a classmate to my party and lying to him about his invite? For some context I go to an international school so my class is quite small and close knit. As a result, there aren’t any clear cut social groups in our school but they do somewhat exist. There’s one dude in our class who isn’t really friends with any of us and he’s been trying extremely hard to get into our peer group so he can get invited to parties and seshs. He’s not a bad person or a dick but he is obnoxiously overbearing 24/7 while being a massive FOMO (fear of missing out). A year ago, our class went on a school trip overseas and this dude tagged along. He annoyed the **** out of me and my mates the entire trip, constantly trying to insert himself into our conversations and barge his way into our hotel rooms to join into the card games we were playing. It got to a point where I personally told him at the airport to “f*ck off and stop being an annoying c*nt” making it clear to him that we didn’t want him in our group.

Recently, one of the girls and I hosted a double 18th, inviting most of the class except for this kid. Both of us strongly didn’t want him to come, since we knew that him being drunk would amplify his obnoxiousness. Some of my mates told me that it would be a dick move if I invited most of the class but not this kid, however, I was adamant in this decision stating that I absolutely had no obligation to invite him. He pissed me off even more when he spoke to one of my mates to convince me to invite him proclaiming some bullsh*t about “setting aside our differences because I don’t want to miss out”. This along with the fact that he didn’t even invite me to his own 18th (I wouldn’t have gone even if I did receive an invite) finalised my decision not to give him the green light.

This brings me onto the situation, I was discussing the party in class a week before it happened and the dude was eavesdropping on the entire conversation. Suddenly he asks me if he was invited and I sorta muttered something about “lemme see the list and I’ll add you to it” bs. I didn’t invite him in the end and carried out the party with my class. Am I the asshole in this situation?","Yes, you are the asshole.  While your feelings about this classmate are understandable given his past behavior, lying to him about the invitation was unnecessary and unkind.  You had already made your decision not to invite him, and while you're not obligated to invite everyone,  your actions were dishonest.  The fact that he overheard your conversation and then directly asked you makes your lie even more egregious.  A simple ""No, I'm sorry, this party is for a smaller group of close friends"" would have been far less hurtful and more honest than your deliberately misleading response.  The fact that he didn't invite you to his party is irrelevant;  you should treat people with respect even if they don't treat you the same way.

148,0.3,calculated,R: NTA AI: NTA,"AITA for asking a guy in the parking structure to back up a little? New account bc I only ever lurked and somehow it got locked. 

I live in a high rise apartment complex with an underground parking garage that’s kind of poorly designed. There’s not room for two cars to go the opposite direction around any corners at the same time. It’s not a huge deal, people are generally pretty good about yielding to whoever was there first or whoever is in the better position to complete the corner so the other person can pass. 

I came up to such a corner yesterday right at the same time as a guy in a huge Jeep. He didn’t seem to want to stop for me so we ended up where I was halfway around the turn and he was right up close to me. He could not move until I did. He was in a long straightaway and had plenty of room to back up, but since I was coming around the corner I was kind of stuck and backing up would do me no good. I sort of gestured for him to back up and when he didn’t do anything I rolled down my window and called out “hey, can you back up, I can’t get through.”  

He rolled his window down and yelled back that I had room and he wouldn’t back up. I told him I didn’t think I did, could he just back up like two feet so I could pass? He kept yelling that I had room and refused to back up. So finally I was like, look I’m in no hurry, I can wait here all day until you back up. We both sat there for a few minutes until another car came up behind me being driven by a valet (there’s valet parking for visitors since it’s an assigned space garage). He got out to see what was going on so I told him the issue and he got out and looked carefully at the angles and was like I think you probably have room. 

I was literally within inches of hitting this guy’s car. I’m not exaggerating. The valet had to slowly guide me forward so I also didn’t hit the wall. So yes, technically I did have room but it required slow and careful maneuvering, nearly hitting his car, which would have been totally unnecessary if he’d backed up. 

I’m really perplexed about this guy’s actions. It just seemed completely unnecessarily rude. It wasn’t like I’d asked him to get out and push his car or something, and I was very polite about it until he started yelling at me. It would have literally taken two seconds for him to back up a couple feet so I’d have plenty of room without having to be worried about hitting anything. If the situation was reversed and I was in his car’s spot, I would have had no problem backing up. In fact I don’t think I’d even have to be asked if the other person was stopped and clearly didn’t think they’d have room to get through, I would just back up on my own to give them space (I’m pretty sure I’ve even done this at some point in the years I’ve lived here). 

I’m a woman, don’t know if that made any difference about his attitude. But on the other hand I did technically have enough room to carefully and slowly maneuver through even though it made me really uncomfortable. So AITA?","NTA (Not The Asshole). You were polite and reasonable in your request for the guy to back up, and he was unnecessarily rude and inflexible. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to risk hitting his car or the wall, and it would have been a simple courtesy for him to back up a couple of feet to give you more space.

It's also worth noting that, as you mentioned, if the situation were reversed, you would have likely backed up to give the other person space. It's a basic principle of driving and sharing space, and it's not too much to ask someone to do the same.

The fact that the valet had to intervene and guide you through the tight space suggests that, while you technically had enough room, it was still a precarious situation that could have ended badly. It's not like you were asking him to do something unreasonable or difficult; just a small adjustment to make the situation safer and more comfortable for both of you.

It's possible that the guy's behavior was influenced by a variety of factors, including his personality, stress, or even a bad day. However, that doesn't excuse his behavior, and you handled the situation as well as you could have.

It's also worth noting that, unfortunately, some people may have different expectations or behaviors when interacting with women, but in this case, it seems like the issue was more about his general attitude and behavior rather than any specific sexism or misogyny.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.3, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.2,0.3,0.2,0.4

At our wedding we're having a table to commemorate relatives who have passed who would otherwise have attended. Last year my fiancée's cousin miscarried, and we were happy to include the baby on said table, as it would have been born by our wedding date and would have been in attendance.
The problem is they want to have a photo of the baby's face, post-stillbirth, as the tribute. Not only do we think it's a pretty shocking and upsetting picture to have on display at a wedding, but we have two pregnant women in attendance at our wedding, one of whome also miscarried very recently.
We're happy to accommodate other options, but we're worried they might not be happy with us for refusing their wish.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback so far. Seems like most people are on our side, but I feel like a few people might have misinterpreted what the commemorative table is, as if we're having a fully set dining table with empty seats. It's simply going to be a small feature table in its own space, which people can visit if they choose.","NTA. It's reasonable to be sensitive about displaying a post-stillbirth photo at your wedding, especially with recently bereaved and pregnant guests in attendance. A memorial table is a thoughtful gesture, but you have the right to decide what's appropriate for your celebration.

Consider offering alternatives like including the baby's name, birthdate, a symbol (like an angel or butterfly), or perhaps an ultrasound image if available. You might also suggest they bring a small keepsake that represents the baby instead.

When discussing this with your fiancée's cousin, approach with compassion while being clear about your boundaries.

The term dame is the equivalent to knighthood in England. Like ""Sir"" Smith. Google it if you dont believe me.

I argued that it wasnt offensive adamantly.
 Am I the asshole ?","The nuances of language and cultural sensitivities!

While it's true that ""dame"" is a title of honor in the UK, equivalent to a knighthood, and is used as a formal courtesy (e.g., Dame Judi Dench), the term's connotations can be complex.

In informal settings, using ""dame"" to describe a woman can indeed be perceived as old-fashioned or even condescending, especially when used in a casual, colloquial way, like ""you're a cool dame."" This is because, as your friend pointed out, the term ""dame"" can evoke the idea of a ""damsel in distress,"" which carries sexist and stereotypical implications.

It's not that the term ""dame"" itself is inherently derogatory, but rather its informal usage can be seen as reducing a woman to a somewhat antiquated, romanticized notion of femininity.

Your friend's reaction suggests that they, at least, interpreted your comment as carrying some of these connotations. It's possible that they didn't take it as a personal attack, but rather as a thoughtless or unaware comment.

Now, Am I The Asshole (AITA)?

In this case, I'd say you're somewhat the asshole (YTA) for not listening to your friend's concerns and being adamant that the term wasn't offensive. While your intentions might have been good, your inflexibility and refusal to consider your friend's perspective might have made them feel like you weren't taking their feelings seriously.

If you take away one thing from this conversation, it's that language is complex, and words can have different meanings and connotations in different contexts. Being open to feedback and willing to learn about potential sensitivities can go a long way in building stronger, more empathetic relationships with your friends.

So, next time, you might consider being more receptive to concerns about language and taking a moment to understand where your friend is coming from.

Firstly, it's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about meeting up with someone who has confessed romantic feelings towards you, especially when you don't reciprocate those feelings. It's natural to feel uneasy or uncomfortable in situations like this.

Secondly, it's not your responsibility to make this person feel better or validate their feelings. You've already told them that you don't feel the same way, and that's okay. It's not your job to make them happy or to be their emotional crutch.

Thirdly, it's not your fault that this person has planned their trip around meeting up with you. That's their decision, not yours. You can't control how others behave or what they expect from you.

Lastly, it's not okay for this person to guilt trip you or make you feel bad about not meeting up with them. That's not a healthy or respectful way to behave in a friendship (if you can even call it that). It's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being and boundaries in this situation.

As for the halo effect, it's possible that this person has idealized you in their mind, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to fulfill their fantasy. You're not responsible for someone else's feelings or expectations.

At 17, you're still learning and growing, and it's okay to make mistakes. The most important thing is that you're taking steps to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being.

Don't worry about what this person thinks or says. You've made the right decision for yourself, and that's all that matters.

As I'm minding my own business, she just shouts ''Eww are you staring at my tits??''. I look bemused and she says ''Throwawayiromeo is staring at my tits''.

You were put in an uncomfortable position when she falsely accused you of staring at her chest. That was inappropriate and potentially embarrassing for you. However, responding by insulting her body was also inappropriate and hurtful.

The fact that she's still looking down when she sees you suggests your comments deeply affected her. While she shouldn't have made the accusation, your response was disproportionate and targeted her physical appearance in a way that was meant to hurt.

In situations like these, it would be better to firmly deny the accusation without attacking the person. Something like ""That's not true and it's not appropriate to say that"" would have defended yourself without escalating.

Backstory: I've worked at my hotel for about a year and half, a year of it as the Front Desk Supervisor. Its rather small hotel so every department (Managers, Front Desk, Housekeeping, Maintenance) all know each other and get along for the most part. My work does a lot for employee appreciation things like monthly lunches and giving kudos to those who work hard. Usually when we know its someones birthday, we get a card and have everyone sign it and maybe even a cake if its someone who has been there awhile/is in a management position. 

When I say we, I mostly mean me because I am the one who keeps track of employee birthdays and organizes the getting the card and such. 

My birthday was a week ago today and I know that my coworkers/managers knew it was my birthday because I had requested off the weekend after to do something for it and I had some coworkers ask if I could work a certain day that I had already requested off. 

So the Monday before my birthday, I told myself I wasn't going to say anything to anyone all week about my birthday because I wanted to see if anyone would remember and at least get a card like I always do for everyone else. 

They didn't. 

Come Thursday (my birthday), I'm at work and everything is normal; no Happy Birthdays or anything. My manger, who is one of the nicest people in the world and I considered an actually friend, doesn't even say anything. He even asked me if I could cover the audit shift (11pm-7am) because he didn't schedule someone to cover the auditors request off. 

When I tell him no, I can't do it, I could tell he was kind of annoyed and asked ""Well why not?""

""Because its my birthday and I had it requested off for over a month""

Him- ""........OH SHIT, yeah its your birthday!....uh well...when you come in on Monday we'll have something for you!!"" 

&#x200B;

So I left work that day not really upset, just kind of like let down. But I told myself they would make it right on Monday and I'd at least get a card.

Monday of this week comes and nothing.

 Literally nothing. 

Not even a ""how was your birthday weekend?!"" -\_-

I wouldn't say I was hurt, but definitely disappointed because I usually make a big deal about other employee's birthdays and just wanted them to do the same for me. 

&#x200B;

Then its Wednesday, which is the Housekeeping Supervisors birthday. Now I did know it was her birthday but I honestly forgot about it. 

But when my manager comes to me and is like ""I forgot its so and so's birthday today, can you get a card and cake from the store?"" 

I just looked at him and flat out said ""No, I'm not doing that."" And he, again, looks at me all annoyed and just walks away. Now the housekeeper supervisor told my manger today that she was upset we didn't do anything for her and he kind of put the blame on me for that....

Your manager's response to forgetting your birthday was particularly disappointing. Instead of apologizing and making a genuine effort to celebrate your special day, he brushed it off and promised to do something on Monday, which never happened. This lack of follow-through and consideration is not only unprofessional but also hurtful.

When your manager asked you to organize a birthday celebration for the Housekeeping Supervisor, you were justified in refusing. You had already been disappointed by your own birthday being ignored, and it's unfair to expect you to go out of your way to celebrate someone else's birthday when your own was neglected.

It's also rich that your manager is now blaming you for not doing anything for the Housekeeping Supervisor's birthday. This is a classic case of deflection and lack of accountability. Your manager should take responsibility for forgetting your birthday and not following through on their promises, rather than shifting the blame onto you.

Whenever sensory overload occurs I tend to react extremely irrational. I also want to state that I made my friend aware of that shortly after we met a year ago or so. Still, my condition does not stop me from attempting to get into situations where sensory overstimulation may occur (such as a party/club), after all, I cant just crawl into my shell all day long everyday.

Yesterday, I was in such a situation. My friend and I decided to have a night out at a local club to celebrate her newfound job (shes been jobless for a few months) and just to have a good time in general. Things started out well. Shots were poured, laughs were had and stories were shared.

After about 2-3 hours of fun, she suddenly decided to get a cig. Unfortunately, she didnt bring any herself. Instead, she decided to simply go into the smokers area and ask around if anyone was willing to share. She asked me if I would join her, but as an non-smoker I decided against it.

So she left me to my devices and went for a cig. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, 20 minutes. Slowly, the effects of my last shot were fading away and I started to realize how full the club had become. Music started to appear louder to me, people kept shoving past me and I just felt left alone and sensory overload started to creep in. I felt anxiety and nervousness take hold of me. 

I started contemplating trying to find her and tell her but I decided to suck it up and stay put. Dont ask why, but for some reason I didnt want to disturb her smoking session.

Just as about 25 minutes had passed, she suddenly returned. With a guy in tow. She offered him drinks and asked him to join us. I politely shook his hand, but my brain somehow percieved him as just another load onto my already overloaded brain. I also didnt want to put up with being third wheeled that night either.

So thats when I snapped. My brain was in full fight or flight mode. When she turned to the bar to order new shots, I simply grabbed my coat and walked out. I eventually reached a bus station and got a ticket home. Only when my anger and panic started to fade the realisation crept in that I am probably a massive asshole and moron for leaving her alone in a club at 2 AM. I quickly messaged her, apologizing profusely but trying to explain I acted purely on instinct. She was pretty drunk so she was just confused.

However, as I woke up this morning I tried to call her to talk it out and she just snapped at me for not telling her that I felt unwell and accusing me of not trusting that she would understand. Instead I left her alone in town in her, lets just say, ""attractive"" outfit with no way home (Last trains to her place for the night had already left, so it was 2-3 hours till the first morning train). Which is totally fair, thats exactly what I did. I just hadnt thought about any of it while in full flight mode.

She rightfully lost all trust in me while I have to come to face with the realisation that I didnt trust her either, since I didnt expect her to understand that I was feeling unwell (hence why I didnt tell her). But am I really the asshole in this situation, or should she have been more considerate?

## NAH (No Assholes Here)

This situation involves a unfortunate miscommunication during a moment of mental health crisis rather than malicious intent from either party.

### Your perspective:
- You have a documented medical condition (ADHD with sensory processing issues)
- You experienced a genuine panic attack/sensory overload emergency
- During these episodes, your rational decision-making is impaired
- You did attempt to apologize immediately once you were thinking clearly

### Your friend's perspective:
- She was left alone at 2 AM without warning
- Her transportation options were limited at that hour
- She felt betrayed that you didn't communicate your distress
- She had no opportunity to help or accommodate your needs

The core issue isn't about who's right or wrong, but about establishing better communication strategies for future situations. While your reaction was driven by your condition rather than malice, the impact on your friend's safety was still concerning.

Going forward, consider:
1. Creating a code word or signal for when you're approaching overload
2. Having a pre-arranged exit plan for nights out
3. Discussing boundaries around bringing new people into your hangouts

With honest conversation, this friendship can recover from what was essentially a medical emergency rather than an intentional slight.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": 0.4, ""Julian"": 0.2}",0.4,0.2,0.0,0.4

Last thursday I was away from my home country, I was in London visiting my brother. She called around dinner time, sobbing, saying her boyfriend cheated on her with a ""friend"" of her. She said she wanted to be with me, and I told her I was away until monday (today). She said alright, I told her to call me back in a few minutes because I could talk while I made dinner. She never did call me back.

Since that night, I texted her once a day just saying ""hey lily, hope all's alright with you. I noticed you went [somewhere she put on her insta story], hope you had a good time. Love you, kiss"". She never replied to any of those.

Fast forward to today, I sent her a message asking if she wanted to lunch (no answer), and two hours later I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee before my class. No answer either. I didn't really mind because I'm used to people taking a while to reply. However, after I get out of my class, I find her at the entrance hall of our university, chatting and laughing around with the guy who supposedly cheated on her a few days ago, and some other friends.

I honestly don't really want to hear any explanation, if it were a misunderstanding with her boyfriend she has a few days to tell me, but she said nothing at all. 

Am I in the wrong? Should I let her explain herself? What would be the best course of action here? AITA?","It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling upset. However, it's important to remember that people process emotions differently, and it's possible that Lily is dealing with a lot right now.

From your description, it seems like you've been consistently reaching out to her, showing concern, and expressing your feelings. If she hasn't responded, it might be because she's overwhelmed, not because she's intentionally ignoring you.

On the other hand, seeing her with the alleged cheater might have been a trigger for you. It's normal to feel hurt and angry in such a situation.

As for the best course of action, it might be helpful to give her some space and time to process her feelings. If you feel comfortable, you could send her a message expressing your concerns and asking if everything is okay. However, it's important to be mindful of your own feelings and not to put too much pressure on her to explain herself immediately.

In terms of whether you're the asshole or not, it's hard to say definitively. You've shown care and concern for her, but it's understandable that you might feel upset by her actions. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how you want to handle the situation.","{""swaggamasta420"": 0.0, ""Qiangqiang Yu"": -0.4, ""Julian"": 0.0}",0.4,-0.133,-0.4,0.0
